## Rolls

Make a Roll when you just need a number within a certain range. Rolls
are for inflicting damage, spell effects, and a great many other things.
These use the d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12 dice, as below:

### Modifiers

A positive or negative number called a ***Modifier*** may alter Roll
results. For example, a 1d8+3 roll would give a result of 4-11. A Roll
can be modified by the relevant Attribute plus
the largest ***Bonus*** (+) and the largest ***Penalty*** (-). This can
reduce the result to zero but not into the negatives.

Normally, bonuses do not stack with other bonuses and penalties do not
stack with other penalties. All you need to consider is the Attribute
used (if any!) and the largest bonus and/or penalty.

{: .text-center}
**Modifier = Attribute + Bonus + Penalty**

Sometimes you will halve or double the result of a Roll. If halved,
always round up.

### Roll-offs

This is when two Rolls oppose each other, a common situation during
feats of might or size. The highest result is the winner, the lowest is
the loser, and ties go to the attacker. Roll-offs decide clash damage and the
winner of Grapples.

### Rerolls

A ***Reroll*** is when a player or Imp picks up a die Roll result they
do not like and rolls it again, choosing the best result. If the result
is the same, *add the two*! Rerolling costs a temporary Willpower (WP,
point. One may only spend a single WP on a given
Roll and cannot Reroll Checks.

##  Checks

Certain actions can either succeed or fail, such as aiming at a foe,
looking for clues to a treasure, convincing villagers not to burn them
alive, etc. Make a ***Check*** in these dramatic situations. This calls
on fate and talent to decide between a *good* and *bad* outcome, based
on what the player says their character is doing.

To make a Check, roll 1d20 plus the relevant Attribute
, then add any modifiers. Adventurers are
broadly competent and get a d20 for vital feats such as Attack
and Grapple. Other
actions require a relevant ***OCS***, standing for ***Origin***
***Career***, or ***Skill***
. If they do not have it, they use 1d12 instead.

If the total result is at or above the action’s ***Difficulty Factor***
(***DF,*** usually 10) it is a success, and the “good” outcome occurs.
If below, it is a failure and the “bad” one occurs. If not obvious, the
Imp may explain the outcomes beforehand. Modifiers apply to Checks just
as they do for Rolls.

**DIFFICULTIES**

{: .lh-0}
| DF  | Narrative Difficulty |
|:---:|:--------------------:|
| 5   | Routine              |
| 10  | Challenging          |
| 15  | Daunting             |
| 20  | Formidable           |
| 25+ | Nigh impossible      |

For example, trying to catch a falling potion might be a Check of 1d20
+<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Dex</span> vs. DF 10. The good outcome could be
“*you catch the potion safely, just inches off the ground*” and the bad
one could be “*it shatters, the precious liquid sinking into the
earth*.”

A “natural” or “raw” result of one; before any modifier, always fails. A
natural twenty always succeeds. These results are otherwise no better or
worse than usual. Whether a result is *better* or *worse* relies on
Gambits, below. A d12 Check always succeeds on a 12 instead, due to
beginners’ luck.

The Imp should not humor utterly impossible acts, and the players should
find other means to move forward. On the other hand, trivial actions
that are highly likely to succeed should simply do so. Part of playing
the Imp is learning where to draw this line.

###  Gambits

Mere success or failure is not the only possible outcome of a Check. A
player may also call for a ***Gambit*** after throwing the dice, pushing
their luck by re-rolling for a better result. After success, succeeding
again results in a triumphant ***Critical,*** while failing means they
have now merely failed. After Failure, succeeding on the Gambit turns it
into a Success while failing again reveals a ruinous ***Botch***. See
the next page for useful Critical & Botch ideas.

The same Modifiers and dice apply to the Gambit as the original Check,
and one can only Gambit once per Check. WP Rerolls do not apply to
Checks, so you cannot spend them on a Gambit either.

- ***Critical*** is a success with benefits. For example, a Critical to
pick a lock might halve the time, while a Critical attack may add
damage.
- ***Botch*** is a failure with a painful drawback or twist. For example,
a Botch to persuade someone may also ruin your relationship, while a
Botched attack might result in a dropped weapon.

Other players can chime in with possible outcomes. To keep this fun from
getting too sadistic, the Scenes chapter gives default
Criticals and Botches for many popular actions. These defaults are a
valid resort for either the Player or Imp if they cannot reach an
agreement quickly. Once either chooses a default, the game moves on.

Gambits are optional! However, players who dare to use them will
understand the heart of this game long before their more cautious
fellows.

| Waste           | Costs about twice the usual materials or coin.                             |

### Teamwork

You can make a single Check for actions involving an entire group, such
as Sneak or Travel. When more
people would help, such as intimidation, this is a ***Strongest-link***
Check. When more people get in the way, such as sneaking around, it is a
***Weakest-link*** Check.

- **Strongest-link** Checks use the best relevant OCS and Attribute out of
the group.
- **Weakest-link** Checks use the best OCS but the lowest relevant
attribute out of the group.

For example, a party would enjoy the guidance of their thief when
sneaking, but a clumsy (low <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Agi</span>) ally
would still hinder them.

### Helping Others

Explain how you helped, then grant your own Success to an ally if they
Failed or Botched earlier. If you get a Critical, you both succeed. The
latter is one of the standard Criticals (Assist ally), below.

## Procedures

You’ve probably already figured out no one can tell you or your group
how to run their own game. The author is not going to smash through your
wall and demand you stop having fun wrong. That said, here are some
helpful suggestions for Players and Imps to get the most out of Eldritch
Gambit.

### Narrating Actions

How you describe actions is up to you. For example, saying “I attack” is
valid, but so is *“I bend back my bowstring and let my arrow fly, aiming
straight for its wretched eye socket.*” See what you enjoy best, but
most groups prefer a little spice.

### Party Conflict

If acting against another PC, avoid hard feelings by letting them
describe the outcome of your action. This is as true for gory attacks as
for social persuasion. For example, a player whose character is
convinced to take the lead may say they do so distrustfully or take
precautions. One shot by another player gets to say where and how bad it
looks, etc.

Keep
in mind the *Player always stays in control of their character*. They
can go along, put their own spin on it, or outright refuse to be
manipulated!

###  To Die or not to Die

Rolling dice is fun, but even the prettiest number rocks can lose their
magic if you call on their oracular powers too often. Players and Imps
alike should think about *when* to use them, not just how!

First, there is no need to start throwing your dice while the Imp tries
to describe what your character encounters. There are no Checks to
notice or detect in this game. Sneak Checks are none of
your business if you aren’t making them, and Insight Checks
only help understand what you see. Instead, you and the
Imp get to work together. Ask the right questions to help imagine the
situation.

Second, instead of asking permission or what you should roll, just
boldly proclaim your action. For example, *“I leap across the balcony,
swinging off the chandelier into the fray!”* The Imp and the rest of
your table are likely to love it and move on. You may do very well
without touching your dice for quite a while. Give them no reason to
doubt and see what you can get away with.

Sometimes a Player will harbor suspicions about an Imp’s action, and
they may call for a Check too. Just like the Imp, they should be careful
not to pull this stunt too often.

The takeaway here is to let the narration come first, mostly calling on
the dice to resolve doubt.



## Example of Play

The following is a short bit of play showcasing Rolls, Rerolls, Checks,
and Gambits. Players are using their character’s names and in-character
speech is in quotation marks. You will understand the actions they take
and the terms they use better as you read further in this book.

Petra the Exiled Amazon and Mazzy the Singing Shepherd have just jumped
off a cliff onto the back of a giant Wyvern to escape a deadly trio of
Gargoyles, as one does.

**Petra:** “Can you fly this thing?”

**Mazzy:** “You’re the Amazon.”

**Petra:** “Where did you get it lodged in your noggin that Amazons flew
around on these things? Hope you have a better idea in there.”

**Mazzy:** Oops. I wonder if I can hold on? Ehh no I am going to use a
different approach. I’m a charming guy so I’ll make some screeching
Wyvern noises and try to calm it…

**Imp:** creative… but unlikely, so Check.

*Mazzy rolls a mere d12 as he has no relevant Career, Origin, or Skill.
He gets a 2, then adds his +3 <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span> for a
total of 5. The Wyvern’s WP is 12 so this fails. Bad luck!*

**Mazzy:** If I can’t control it the Gargoyles might catch us. I’m going
to use a Gambit; if we fail, I don’t just lose control - the new
consequence is the Wyvern will try to throw us off!

**Imp:** That’s a great consequence, but I’ll lessen it so it will only
try to throw Petra off.

**Petra:** Jerk!

*This time, Mazzy rolls a 9 for a total of 12. Still low, but just
enough to reach the Wyvern’s 12 WP.*

**Imp:** Much to your relief, it calms down a little and starts to soar.
But it is still skittish, and you know better than to trust the thing.
The Gargoyles can fly too, of course, and they are right behind you.

**Petra:** Whew! I would have found a way to take you down with me if I
fell, you know.

**Mazzy:** Harsh. I mean I would have saved you somehow... “Ok Petra,
you shoot!”

**Petra:** I level my flame staff on the gargoyle as it swoops in…
rolled a 14 plus my <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Dex</span> of 2 – 16!

**Imp:** hit him dead on, roll damage.

**Petra:** ok, the flame stave does 1d12, +1 for my Charisma…and it’s a
2? Ugh. I spend a WP and Reroll the 2… that’s a 10, so now it’s 11
damage. Wow, I am on fire tonight!

**Imp:** …and so is the Gargoyle. Eleven is over its HP so it drops out
of the sky trailing smoke. One of the other Gargoyles swoops down to try
and catch it. The third and last one glares at you, enraged, but it also
flies off.

**Mazzy:** Weird. That is not how I thought this sort of monster would
act.

**Petra:** Yeah, they really seem to look out for each other. I wonder
what that is about?
