## Templates

Every character has a ***Template*** to describe their basic form as
well as how they are different from a human. A Template a set of helpful
or harmful ***Traits;*** animal, monstrous, or alien. This method
handles transformations, body-swapping, mutations, curses, and other
strangeness with little fuss.

Traits are treated as special equipment that cannot be removed, for
better or worse. As such, they inflict or relieve ***Load,*** as in the
Encumbrance section. Traits with positive Load
are advantages, those with zero Load balance out, and negatives relieve
Load. Creatures with many abilities and few drawbacks pay for it with a
lot of innate Load. This means fantastic creatures like dragons tend not
to carry around a lot of stuff. Aside from the obvious metabolic strain,
it is hard to fit a backpack over dorsal spines and giant wings.

Many of the Traits below may give unstated benefits or drawbacks. For
example, a character with the Size (Small) Trait would be able to fit
through tight openings and such without saying so explicitly.

###  Size

Fantasy fights often involve wildly mismatched opponents - giants vs.
dwarves, elves vs. elephants, knights vs. windmills, etc. Each size step
is a huge increase in height and weight. Creatures with a Size larger
than human get more HP to account for this. This has diminishing returns
at larger sizes, as their weak points and vitals are also larger
targets. <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Str</span> modifiers reflect lesser
differences within a Size category, such as between breeds of horses.

Size does not affect the <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Str</span> Attribute
itself. Instead, it changes the dice for damage and Rallies. For
example, a medium-sized character with +1 <span
class="smallcaps">Str</span> and a dagger does 1d6+1 damage, a large one
does 2d6+1, and a small one does 1d4+1. A Critical works as usual,
adding the max of one die to the Roll. In this case, the medium-sized
character would do 1d6+7, the large one 2d6+7, and the small one 1d4+5.

Load for carried gear is scaled to human size. If it comes up, you can
use the Rolls column to scale Load for other Sizes. A Tiny creature
would count 1 Load as 3, a Large one would count 2 Load as 1, and so on.

**SIZES**

| Size    | Rolls\*   | HP\*\* | Example  |
|---------|:---------:|:------:|----------|
| Tiny    | 2 smaller | \-     | Mouse    |
| Small   | 1 smaller | \-     | Cat      |
| Medium  | 1d        | \-     | Human    |
| Large   | 2d        | x2     | Horse    |
| Huge    | 3d        | x3     | Rhino    |
| Giant   | 4d        | x4     | Elephant |
| Titanic | 5d        | x5     | Whale    |

*\* before adding <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Str</span> (damage) or <span
class="smallcaps">End</span> (Rally).*

*\*\* also applies to AP (Armor Points)*

The Tiny and Small Sizes reduce die to a smaller type. For example, d12
to d10 is one smaller while d8 to d4 would be two. This can take a d4
down to uncommon die sizes: ***d3*** (d6/2) or ***d2*** (d4/2).

While larger Size can be a big advantage, it can also make it harder to
use cover, entrances, mounts, clothes, or vehicles made for smaller
folks. Falling does more damage to larger creatures, raising the damage
by their HP multiple in the table above.


**LIST OF TRAITS**

- **Amorphous:** a body with no solid form, such as a slime or amoeba.
Those with this Trait take half damage from attacks without an Element,
such as most physical weapons. They can also squooze through small
openings, which takes one Move Action per Size difference between the
creature and the opening. Larger worn items might not be able to pass
through with them.

- **Armored:** covered in a leathery hide, scaly plates, force fields,
thick fur, etc. There are four levels of this (light, medium, heavy,
ultra), matching the types of armor available as gear. This includes the
usual Rally die type increase from armor.
- **Attack:** claws, teeth, horns, breath weapons, spurs, stingers, etc.
Different types (Close, Strike, Reach, etc.) reflect the diversity of
natural attacks. Size applies to the damage dice used, and Elements can
be chosen just as with Spells.
- **Bane:** harmed by something harmless to most humans, like a vampire
turning to ash in sunlight or a werewolf’s weakness to silver. Rare
banes like silver are -1 Load, while something common like sunlight is
-2. Exposure inflicts the Burning Status, meaning they cannot Rally and
take 1d6 damage per Round.
- **Climb:** a body made for climbing such as a squirrel, caterpillar, or
monkey. This halves the DF on Move Checks to climb obstacles or scale
foes.
- **Drain (Template):** absorb the life force of others. If *Staggered*,
they may immediately clear this Status by inflicting the Fallen status
on a living victim of the chosen Template. the draining attack must use
either an unarmed bite or other specific method.
- **Explosive:** explodes when defeated. Fallen creatures with this Trait
die instantly but inflict 1d8<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">+Str</span> damage
to all in the same Zone. Size affects these dice as usual.
- **Fast:** can run amazingly fast, like a horse or a cheetah. Add a Zone
of Move for each Load, with finer differences in speed reflected by
their <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Agi</span>.
- **Flammable:** catches fire easily when exposed to an open flame, common
for dusty undead or things made of wood or paper. If hit with a Fire
Element or otherwise exposed to flame, they suffer the Burning status.
- **Flight:** the creature has wings or other powers allowing them to fly
freely. They may Move two Zones in any direction, negate falls if
conscious, and ignore most obstacles.
- **Graspless:** lacks hands or fine manipulators and cannot wield most
weapons or tools.
- **Immobile:** cannot Move effectively on their own and do not get a Move
or Free Move.
- **Innate Spell:** the creature can cast a certain Spell without Learning
it or using a Materia or Ephemera. This can be taken multiple times for
different Spells. This is good for magical creatures or gifted humans.
- **Jump:** the creature has strong legs or other apparatus enabling
amazing leaps. The character may use their Move to leap an entire Zone
upwards or two across. This also halves fall damage and the difficulty
of overcoming most obstacles.
- **Keen Smell & Hearing:** sensitive ears and nose, like those of a dog
or elephant. Always count as alert and face only half DF for Insight
Checks reliant on smell or hearing.
- **Keen Vision:** sharp eyes like those of a hawk or mantis shrimp.
Always count as Alert and face only half DF for Insight Checks reliant
on vision.
- **Mimicry:** the creature can change their outward form to seem like
another object or creature. Nearly indistinguishable from the original,
they halve their Sneak DF if fittingly disguised.
- **Nightvision:** see perfectly well in the dark, like a cat or other
nocturnal hunter. This negates visibility penalties for darkness unless
entirely pitch black, such as a well-sealed room or deep cavern.
- **Regeneration:** a healing factor or a strange body type that springs
back quickly from injury. Their Recovery Checks are at half DF.
- **Resistance:** insulating fur against cold, a ceramic shell to protect
from heat, etc. An Element like Fire, Cold, Void, etc. or weapon quality
like Stun, Area effect, etc. must be chosen. This means they can easily
weather certain climates and halve damage coming from that Element.
- **Shifter:** the creature can change into another form as part of their
Rally action. Make a new Template for the alternate form. If the other
form does not also have the Transform Trait, it is one-way, and they
cannot shift back!
- **Size:** difference in Size when compared to a human. This alters HP
and damage/rally dice. Details are given in the Size paragraph above
.
- **Skeletal:** having no flesh means cutting and piercing weapons are
less effective. Physical attacks made by weapons without the Stun
feature do half damage. They also sink like a stone in water, facing
double DF when swimming.
- **Slow:** like a slug or sloth. It takes two Move Actions to move one
Zone.
- **Speechless:** cannot use spoken language as we know it, limited to
basic grunts or calls.
- **Stretch:** a long appendage or stretchy limbs reach all the way into
adjacent Zones. These can take Actions or make Melee Attacks as if they
were in the next Zone. Obstacles lessened by reaching to or over them
present half their usual DF.
- **Undead:** an animate corpse. Undead are immune to Poison, Disease, and
Deprivation but cannot make Recovery Checks. Many undead also have the
Drain Trait to get around this limitation.
- **Unstable:** it is possible to dispel or undo the magic that animates
the creature. A Dispel will kill them outright if successful. This
Dispel is at d12 unless the caster has the Spell that animated them or
is using the *Purge* Spell.
- **Venomous:** an insidious venom like that of a snake, platypus, or
scorpion. This applies to a specific damaging Attack, whether unarmed or
with a natural weapon. The poison is lethal with a 1d6 Buildup per
round. Each extra Load adds a dose to the attack.
- **Vulnerability:** overly affected by the elements. Choose an Element
tag like Fire, Cold, Void, etc. or weapon quality like Stun, Area
effect, etc. for each Vulnerability taken. This means they have a hard
time in related climates and take double damage from that Element or
weapon quality.

### Sentient Animals

A common theme in fantasy stories and settings, especially as victims of
transformation magic. Animal characters choose or roll Attributes as
normal. If they have human intelligence, they should also choose an OCS
that shows it, just like a human character. If the animal form normally
has the Speechless or Graspless Traits, those may be bought off as Load.

### Non-human PCs

Settings often have non-human or demi-human options, like elves,
dwarves, androids, minotaurs, etc. This is easy enough to do just by
creating a Template for them. If they have strong innate leanings toward
certain Attributes, it is enough to say the favored Attribute should not
be their lowest.

### Mutant Casters

Clever human characters, or at least their players, might figure out
they can cast Spells without Materia or Ephemera if they change their
Templates to include *Innate Spell*. Artifacts may exist that allow
permanent changes to their form. Arguably, changing their Template makes
them no longer purely human, and they must deal with the resulting Load
and whatever identity crises result.

Occasionally, a gifted human is born who can cast Spells on their own
via the Innate Spell Trait. This usually causes them more than their
fair share of problems.

## Threat

To make things easier on Imps, un-named NPCs do not need a full set of
Attributes. Instead, they get a ***Threat*** rating consisting of two
numbers divided by a plus or minus sign, i.e., “2+1” or “5+3.”

The first part of a Threat rating is their ***Base***, which replaces
Attributes on Checks and Rolls. Add 10 and you a DF that forms their WP
and AF. Multiply by 5 to get HP. Not all NPCs with a Threat rating are
dangerous, but they could be.

The second part is their current Load from gear or special abilities.
This factor drastically influences the danger involved in facing them.
The max current Load is Base x 2, so it is not unusual to see creatures
with Load higher than their Threat Base. This should only be for gear or
Traits, do not count benign burdens like gold or backpacks for this.

{: .text-center }
**THREAT**

{: .lh-0}
| Base | DF  | HP  | Max Load | Level |
|:----:|:---:|:---:|:--------:|:-----:|
| 1    | 11  | 5   | 2        | 4-7   |
| 2    | 12  | 10  | 4        | 8-11  |
| 3    | 13  | 15  | 6        | 12-15 |
| 4    | 14  | 20  | 8        | 16-19 |
| 5    | 15  | 25  | 10       | 20-23 |
| 6    | 16  | 30  | 12       | 24-27 |

*…and so on.*

While un-named (Threat-level) NPCs get a WP score to resist mental and
social Checks, they cannot normally spend WP.

Named NPCs and some unique monsters still use full Attribute sets like a
PC. If you need to convert, every four full Levels is worth about 1
Threat Base, and vice-versa. This is shown in the last column of the
Threat table above, for reference.

### OSR Conversions

One way to convert creatures from Old School Revival (OSR) and similar
games is to let the total of Threat and Load stand in for a creature’s
“HD.” For example a creature from a bestiary with 7 HD might have a Base
of 4 and 3 Load from Traits, or any other combination. In practice and
across all sorts of RPGs, there is no truly accurate scheme for
comparing power levels. This will give you a place to *start* cross-game
comparisons, however.

## Sample Creatures

The section to follow presents a smattering of classic fantasy NPCs
including creatures, people, and monsters. These make it easy to run a
typical adventure and to guide you in making NPCs for your own setting.
This is not a detailed bestiary; it is only a set of convenient examples
to get you going.

For unnamed NPCs, the title of each entry is their Template, with their
Career behind a comma. For example, “Human, Peasant.” This gives them a
d20 on anything they should know relating to either. For example, a
“Squirrel” would get a d20 on gathering nuts, chattering, and scurrying
but not for translating ancient languages or lying about gods. Only
named or unique NPCs get a full and specific PC writeup with Quest,
Origin, Skills, etc.

The following entries show creatures at their typical Threat. Imps may
always boost them to portray elite examples of their ilk or even just to
nudge them up to an appropriate level for the setting or adventure.

### Babblin

**Threat:** 1+1 \
**Base:** +1 \
**DF:** 11 \
**HP:** 5 \
**Rally:** 1d4+1 \
**Size:** Medium \
**Move:** 1 \
**Attacks:**
-   Claws & Teeth: (Hit +2, 1d6+1 dmg)
-   Spell (Confuse): Check +1 vs. WP to Confuse.

**Defenses:** none \
**Template:** Babblin \[*Attack (close), Innate Spell (Confuse),
Speechless*\].\
**Gear:** torn clothing

These gibbering reptilian monsters endlessly seek an unknown Artifact,
perhaps to reverse their hideous transformation. In combat, they use
their Confuse Spell to set their target babbling as well, then rend the
delirious victims with their claws and teeth.

###  Creep Candle

**Threat:** 1-3 \
**Base:** +1 \
**DF:** 11 \
**HP:** 5 \
**Rally:** 1d3+1 \
**Size:** Small \
**Move:** ½ (Slow) \
**Attacks:**
-   Digestion: Hit +1, ½d4+1 (2-3) dmg
-   Explosion (at &lt;0 HP): 1d3+1 dmg to Zone

**Defenses:** none \
**Template:** Lambent Polyp \[*Explosive, Climb, Size(small), Slow,
Speechless, Graspless*\] \
**Gear:** none, random animal bones.

Glowing puffballs drawn toward the warmth of the living; they provide
light but get underfoot. If killed, they explode in a cloud of spores
and gravel. Mostly a nuisance to adventurers trying to rest, as the
unwary may wake up covered in them.

### Dragon, young

**Threat:** 4+6 \
**Base:** +4 \
**DF:** 14 \
**HP:** 50 \
**Rally:** 2d6+4 \
**Size:** Large \
**Move:** 1 \
**Attacks:**
-   Bite/Claw: (Hit +2, 2d6+5 dmg, Grapple)
-   Fiery Breath: (2d6+5 Fire dmg to Zone, Rng 2)

**Defenses:** Scaly hide (5AP), Resist Fire (½ dmg). \
**Template:** Dragon, young \[Size (large), Flight, Armor (light),
Resistance (Fire), Vulnerability (Cold), Attack (close), Attack (ranged
area, Fire)\]. \
**Gear:** none on them, but there is probably 1d12 x 1000 cp of starter
loot hidden away somewhere.

Immature and arrogant. Only the size of a large horse, but eager to make
their scorch mark on the world. In combat, they like to first pick off
stragglers then use their fiery breath on those who bunch up in a group
for protection.

###  Grue

**Threat:** 3+2 \
**Base:** +3 \
**DF:** 13 \
**HP:** 30 \
**Rally:** 2d6+3 \
**Size:** Large \
**Move:** 1 \
**Attacks:**
-   Maul: (Hit +4, dmg 2d6+3)

**Defenses:** none \
**Template:** Grue \[Nightvision, Attack(close), Size(large),
Bane(light)\] \
**Gear:** none

An unseen devourer in the darkness that stalks intruders. Many say they
do not exist and are only waking nightmares, and this is at least partly
true. Their shadowy forms will flicker away when exposed to light, each
unfortunate witness seeing a different umbral form.

### Horse, Riding

**Threat:** 2+1 \
**Base:** +2 \
**DF:** 12 \
**HP:** 20 \
**Rally:** 2d4+2 \
**Size:** Large \
**Move**: 2 \
**Attacks:**
-   Kick: (Hit +3, 2d4+2 dmg)

**Defenses:** none \
**Template:** Horse \[*Fast, Size (large), Speechless, Graspless*\] \
**Gear:** saddle, bridle, horseshoes.

Speedy and self-sufficient, horses are commonly ridden by adventurers
and are a great aid to long journeys, halving travel times in friendly
terrain. If they cannot run from a fight, they can trample or kick with
their hooves. They can also wear barding, which acts as Armor of its
type.

###  Human, Librarian

**Threat:** 1+0 \
**Base:** +1 \
**DF:** 11 \
**HP:** 5 \
**Rally:** 1d4+1 \
**Size:** Medium \
**Move:** 1 \
**Attacks:**
-   Dagger (Hit +2, 1d6+1 dmg, Rng 1)

**Defenses:** none \
**Template:** Human \
**Gear:** librarian robes, 3d6 cp.

Librarians keep themselves busy knowing where books are and shushing
noisy adventurers. The job attracts those who are intelligent,
detail-oriented, and reverent of musty old tomes.

### Human, Zombie

**Threat:** 1-2\* \
**Base:** +1 \
**DF:** 11 \
**HP:** 5 \
**Rally:** 1d4+1 \
**Size:** Medium \
**Move:** 1 \
**Attacks:** \
-   Bite (Hit +0, 1d4+1 dmg)

**Defenses:** none \
**Template:** Human \[Undead, Unstable\] \
**Gear:** rotting clothes, \*or as in life if recently raised.

Risen to a mockery of life by foul necromancy, these creatures are
doomed echoes of their former selves. In combat, Zombies will grapple
and bite. Though it is a terrible waste, those given weapons and even
magic items can still use them.

###  Mimic

**Threat:** 3+0
**Base:** +3 \
**DF:** 13 \
**HP:** 15 \
**Rally:** 1d4+3 \
**Size:** Medium \
**Move:** 1 \
**Attacks:**
-   Toothy maw: (Hit +5, 1d6+6 dmg, Grapple)

**Defenses:** Mimicry \
**Template:** Mimic \[*Mimicry, Attack (close), Speechless*\] \
**Gear:** 1-20 cp in the mimic, another 1-100 cp worth of treasure
scattered as bait.

Mimics lie in wait disguised as carrion or treasure, then spring to life
and devour their greedy victims. A mimic makes a Sneak Check at half DF
when adventurers arrive. They seem just as happy to Attack if spotted
beforehand, however. The loot the mimic used as a model is often nearby.

### Noodler

**Threat:** 1+0 \
**Base:** +1 \
**DF:** 11 \
**HP:** 5 \
**Rally:** 1d4+1 \
**Size:** Medium \
**Move:** 1 \
**Attacks:**
-   Grapple: Hit +2, 1d4+1 dmg, Range 1 due to *Stretch*)

**Defenses: Amorphous (**½ physical dmg) Flammable, Vulnerability (2x
Fire dmg) \
**Template:** Noodler \[*Amorphous, Stretch, Flammable, Vulnerability
(Fire)*\] \
**Gear:** torn clothing

These slender, ropy figures slip in and out of tiny cracks in caverns,
dungeons, and ruins. Some say they were once human, others wriggling
conspiracies of worms. Perhaps they are both, now. Whatever they are
possesses an animal cunning, leading them to wait by traps to feed on
the remains of the unwary.
