You may skip steps or take them in a different order if you please. | Level : the overall power and experience of the character. Most groups start at Level 10. | Concept : choose a Name, Class, Quest, Origin, Template, and Description to give them a place in the game world. | Attributes : set starting Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Agility, Charisma, and Endurance to give them power over the game world. | Defenses : set Willpower, Agility Factor, and Hit Points to give them their defenses. | Skills : choose up to 3 specific freeform talents to round them out and add interest. | Gear : buy or choose weapons, armor, and other items to properly equip them. | . A player may start even without having chosen all their Concepts, Attributes, Skills, or Gear. These Details may arise spontaneously as “development” in the first few games or so. ",

    "title": "Level",
    "content": "The Level describes how powerful the character is, with most groups starting at Level 10. The higher the Level, the more Attribute points they have in total. The most (“max”) you can put into an Attribute is half the Level, rounded up. Attributes are explained soon in this chapter . For now, consider them a way of showing what your character is best at. A standard tenth Level character starts out heroic and advances slowly. This gives them time to focus outwards, flexing their power and making their mark on the world. Characters add a Level whenever they earn as many XP as their current Level. The player then raises the Level by one and erases the old XP, keeping any left over. Characters get 1-3 XP when the player recounts their favorite highlights from the last session or reaps a Quest reward.

    "title": "Concept",
    "content": "Next, think about your character’s Concept, the basic ideas you have about them before getting to their numbered stats. This breaks down into their Name, Class, Quest, Origin, Template, and Description. If you are having a tough time choosing these now, you may choose later - even during the actual game! You will miss out on their benefits until then, however. Name . What does your character go by? This is often a family name, nickname, or title. There is space for pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.). Make sure their name is easy to pronounce and fits the setting. If you have trouble, roll 5d6 below, ask the group for ideas, or just come back to it later. Examples: Emmet Falco, Tiny Toes, Celestia Alurian, Onion Bob, Sandalphon, Gruz, etc. NAME SEEDS . | 5d6 | Initial | Examples | . | 5 | U | Utrid, Uriah, Ulthar… | . | 6 | Z | Zack, Zeno, Zelda… | . | 7 | O | Oleg, Oliver, Ondine… | . | 8 | V | Vonn, Vincent, Vera… | . | 9 | N | Nisha, Negan, Nemo… | . | 10 | W | Wash, Wei, Will… | . | 11 | G | Geralt, Gina, Gort… | . | 12 | T | Topaz, Terra, Thane… | . | 13 | B | Bina, Bahb, Brutus… | . | 14 | S | Selena, Stavros, Simm… | . | 15 | C | Cullen, Cora, Cran… | . | 16 | R | Reba, Rhett, Ruprekt… | . | 17 | J | Jona, Jerm, Jubal… | . | 18 | M | Marik, Merina, Mordo… | . | 19 | D | Dorf, Deren, Dagnert… | . | 20 | A | Alistair, Arok, Ainu… | . | 21 | L | Lemuel, Lear, Lana… | . | 22 | E | Egon, Eva, Einz… | . | 23 | K | Ketch, Kroma, Kavon… | . | 24 | P | Pike, Palla, Portia… | . | 25 | H | Heff, Hali, Habra… | . | 26 | F | Finn, Fianna, Fenty… | . | 27 | I | Iggy, Irina, Islington… | . | 28 | Y | Yg, Yelen, Yakov… | . | 29 | Q | Q, Quint, Qera… | . | 30 | X | Xul, Xena, Xavier… | . Class . What is your character’s primary career, talent, or calling? This reflects their style of intelligence, so Checks related to Class use a d20 instead of just a d12. Specific Class names are best; vague ones like “Adventurer” might seem clever at first but rarely end up fitting a specific action. Adding a flavorful adjective helps make them unique and can even justify the d20 applying to more actions! . One either has a d20 on related tasks or not. Proficiency beyond that is a matter of having good Attributes, equipment, resources, contacts, hirelings, magic, and supporting Skills . Examples: Skeptical Priest, Smasher of the Old Ways, Humble wizard, Mercenary Captain, Itinerant Yogurt Salesman, Haughty Courtesan, etc. Quest . What drives your character to adventure? Quests can include anything from base greed to the search for enlightenment. These should be meaningful and specific, but achievable within a few sessions. Try to break grand Quests into smaller steps, which is good for the narrative as well as feasibility. If you complete a Quest, you get back twice the XP you invested. See the Advancement section for more details . Look forward to changing Quests often as the character grows or faces new situations. Examples: Revenge on the orc commander for taking my place, Win the local bar’s ostrich wing-eating competition, Prove loyalty to the gnomes. Origin . Everyone comes from somewhere, where does your character hail from? Origins should be strongly linked to the setting and may include formative events that bring them to this moment. These work like Classes but grant d20 for local knowledge and speaking their native language. One-shot games and dungeon-crawls without any reference to the outside world might never call for this. For more elaborate campaigns, it can be vital. If your group is using a collaborative setting , you may be able to make up your own homelands and do world-building as a Player! . Examples: Eldest daughter of the Argos village chieftain, Raised by dire wolves, Baker’s boy from Crosston, River City Delinquent, etc. Template . What sort of creature is your character? Put their species, model, clade, “race,” etc., here. Eldritch Gambit assumes, perhaps unjustly, that your setting at least has humans. As such, most need only put “Human” here, implying no further changes. Other Templates may have Traits describing how they differ from humans, for better or worse. Weird things can happen during an adventure. Even a baseline human can gain Traits from magic or affliction. The Templates section has more information, including how to play non-human, animal, or even monstrous forms as characters. Description . What do others see when they meet your character? This is a short sentence or two including evocative features like physical build, age, sex, and a distinctive quirk. It helps some players to just pick a few notable things and write them in the Description area of the character sheet. A random (d20) table for a distinctive feature is below for inspiration. Examples: A sad young woman with impossibly blue skin. A frog transformed into a human who still ribbits when nervous, a burly old man with a scar over one eye. DESCRIPTION SEEDS . | D20 | Distinctive Quirk | . | 1 | Ailment (chronic sneeze, cough…) | . | 2 | Atavism (catlike, mousy, caveman…) | . | 3 | Bearing (twitchy, regal, shifty…) | . | 4 | Dress (Snappy, slovenly, antiquated…) | . | 5 | Ears (pointed, cauliflower, huge…) | . | 6 | Eyes (close-set, piercing, wide, blue…) | . | 7 | Face (pinched, cherubic, floppy…) | . | 8 | Fear (abandonment, ham, bridges…) | . | 9 | Gait (stiff, serpentine, trembling…) | . | 10 | Growth (horn, hump, benign tumor…) | . | 11 | Habit (catchphrase, nervous tic…) | . | 12 | Hair (pompadour, bald, blue…) | . | 13 | Hands extra finger, webbed, huge…) | . | 14 | Item (trinket, lucky hat, handcuffs…) | . | 15 | Mouth (wide, full, toothy grin…) | . | 16 | Nose (broad, flat, long, red…) | . | 17 | Physique (short, tall, skinny, stout…) | . | 18 | Skin (birthmarks, scars, acne…) | . | 19 | Tattoo (artistic, tribal, prison…) | . | 20 | Voice (gruff, flat, high-pitched…) | .

    "title": "Attributes",
    "content": "Each character has six Attributes to define their strengths and weaknesses: Strength (Str), Wisdom (Wis), Dexterity (Dex), Agility (Agi), Charisma (Cha), and Endurance (End). An average person would have about one in each. Anything above one is exceptional and more befitting of an adventurer. You may have a negative Attribute if you wish but get no points back for it. A character gets Attribute points or “pluses” to distribute equal to their Level. Fantasy settings allow for incredibly high Attributes, with a max of half the character’s Level, rounded up. ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTIONS . | Attribute | Description | . | -2 | Abysmal | . | -1 | Poor | . | 0 | Low | . | +1 | Normal | . | +2 | High | . | +3 | Very high | . | +4 | Great | . | +5 | Optimal | . It is not unusual for high-level characters to have “superhuman” Attributes of +6 or more. The Basics and Scenes chapters give examples of how these Attributes can be used. You may also roll Attributes randomly. To do this, roll d6 equal to Level, then put each 1 into Str, each 2 into Wis, each 3 into Dex, each 4 into Agi, each 5 into Cha, and each 6 into End. Your final Attribute score equals the number of dice in that Attribute. If more than half the dice end up in one Attribute, flip the excess dice over to their opposite side and put them in that Attribute instead. RANDOM ROLL METHOD . THE ATTRIBUTES . Strength (Str) . Brawn and muscle. Adds weapon damage, boosts Hit Points (HP, and helps to carry heavier loads. Used for Rolls more than Checks. The pride of every mighty warrior. Wisdom (Wis) . Cunning and Fortitude. Aids Checks to create, remember, or discover and forms the Willpower (WP, defense. In a world of magic, the mind is the most powerful weapon. Dexterity (Dex) . Finesse and manual coordination. Aids accuracy of attacks, whether melee, ranged or spell. Also linked to handsy feats of grasping, stealing, or catching. Agility (Agi) . Reflexes and athletic ability. This forms the Agility Factor (AF, and adds to Checks for athletic actions. Get into or out of trouble faster. Charisma (Cha) . Presence, and persuasion. Adds to Checks for trying to get one’s way in tense situations and empower Spells. Those who want to become legends will invest here. Endurance (End) . Constitution and stamina. Resists Afflictions, burdens, and injury, boosts Hit Points (HP, and Rallies . Everyone can use this when the going gets tough. ",

    "title": "Defenses",
    "content": "Derived from Attributes, these keep track of how far one is from suffering setbacks like injury, stress, or death. You can find Defenses on the far-right edge of the character sheet, making them easy to mark and erase during play. DEFENSES . | Defense | Abbr. | Base | . | Agility Factor | “AF” | 10 + Agi | . | Hit Points | “HP” | Level + Str + End | . | Willpower | “WP” | 10 + Wis | . Willpower (WP) . This crucial gauge of mental reserve tracks how well the character is coping. WP is equal to ten plus Wis. This serves two purposes, both at odds with the other! First, it is the character’s DF when foiling stealth or the mental influence of others. Second, they can spend each point to Reroll a die. Ultimately, one must decide when to boost their character’s effect on the world at the cost of their resolve. The use of magic items called Materia also takes its toll on the mind. Readying a Materia costs a WP, which cannot be regained until the item is discarded or finds its way into someone else’s hands. WP can only drop to half before self-preservation and fatigue kicks in. Luckily, Fellowship with other characters can restore it. Starting a new campaign refills it entirely. Normally, one can only spend WP on their own Rolls. The exception is that Fallen or Dead characters may spend WP on Rolls made by allies. Attribute this to ghostly intervention, vengeful comrades, or pure coincidence. It does however give the unfortunate a way to contribute. Agility Factor (AF) . This is how hard it is for an opponent to hit the character, whether due to lightning reflexes, keen situational awareness, or the lack of either. A foe must beat this on their Attack Check to successfully hit them. Shields add a bonus directly to AF, so the +Shield box is for those wielding one. Hit Points (HP) . A rough measure of how far the character is from doom. These are a murky combo of stamina, morale, and luck. Being low on HP simply means the next blow they take may be their last. Base HP is equal to Level + Str + End, and this may go down from damage and back up from Rallies . Armor adds its Armor Points (AP) to HP, totaled in the Armored box. The Current box tracks damage to HP. The Rally box is how many HP can be recovered with a Rally Action . The Rally die also improves with armor. For example, a Level 10 character with 2 Str and 4 End gets 16 Base HP. They can Rally for 1d4+4 HP. If they wear leather armor granting 5 AP, their Armored HP jumps to 21 and their Rally to 1d6+4. Damage lowers current HP by that amount. A combatant can stand and fight as long as they have HP left. At zero or below, they are Fallen. Likewise, any hit that drops someone to zero or lower is a Felling blow. Fallen may or may not mean dead, depending on their later Recovery Check . If the incoming hit is not a Felling blow, Players may choose to Stagger. This negates that damage entirely but inflicts the Staggered Status. It’s best to do this only in the face of massive damage or when dangerously close to zero HP. Once Staggered, they cannot Stagger again until that Status clears. HP Status Effects . | Staggered combatants have taken a nasty wound. They lose their Free Move until Recovery and all Checks are made on a d12 instead of d20. | Fallen combatants have dropped to the ground. They get no Action, and their AF drops to zero. | Dead means time to make a new character. This happens on a failed Recovery Check or any doom the Player and Imp feel were not survivable. Powerful Artifacts may be able to reverse Death, depending on the setting. | . Status . There are other baleful effects one may fall under beyond the usual Staggered, Fallen, or Dead above. Usually temporary, there is ample room for these on the blank “Status” section on the right hand side of the character sheet. | Blinded: Cannot see or do things entirely reliant on sight, such as reading. Checks partly reliant on sight face a -4 penalty, and foes count as if behind Soft Cover (-4). Lasts until treated or recovered. | Burning: a burning character takes 1d6 fire damage at the top of each round. They also cannot Rally , as being on fire is a real mood-killer. A Use Action narrated as rolling, dousing, etc. may extinguish the flames and end this status. | Confused: stunned, baffled, or hallucinating. Checks turning up an odd (raw) number on the dice fail due to whatever nonsense they are thinking. | Deafened: cannot hear or perform tasks reliant on hearing, like commands or music. Sign language or lip-reading OCS may alleviate this. | Diseased: failed a Recovery Check after exposure to an infection . Can get better or worse with later Recovery Checks. | Encumbered: burdened with a Load over Str + End. The Encumbered take two Moves to cross a Zone. If Load exceeds twice Str + End, they are Incapacitated. Dropping Load ends this effect. | Grappled: partly restrained but struggling. Grappled characters lose their Action until their attacker loses hold of them. | Incapacitated: paralyzed, drugged, or overburdened. They lose their Action and AF drops to zero. Ends when the Spell, Affliction, or Encumbrance does. | Poisoned: suffering from a poison Buildup Roll. Record the Buildup with the Status. If the total exceeds their Base HP, the poison takes effect. | Surprised: unaware combatants lose their Action for the first Initiative Round and halve their AF. This ends next Round when they recover their wits. | . ",

Skills are more specific but not as serious as Classes or Origins, so have fun with them! . All characters can choose up to three Skills at the start, though they can gain more later via Training Montages . You may leave some blank and choose them later. If a character reveals a suspiciously convenient Skill during play, they should make up a likely story about why they have it. Like Classes and Origin, broadly worded Skills may backfire if they are not a good fit for the task. To prevent this, try to phrase Skills as “Verb-noun” combos such as “Assess treasure”, “Skin carcasses,” or “Speak Dwarvish.” If you are playing in a well-defined setting, there may be thematic Skills ready for you to choose from. This helps ensure the character fits in and gets to use their talents. Players may ask others to think up a Skill for them.

    "content": "What one chooses to carry with them can be as revealing of character as any other aspect. It’s a bit much to deal with right out of the gate, so starting characters have the option of choosing from the list below to make things quick. Make sure you have any gear you need to do things related to your Class, Origin, and Skills. The Player may spend coins on other gear, and the Imp may grant more or less if it fits the character and setting. The Resources chapter has more info. Magic-users and the well-prepared may want to buy Ephemera like potions and scrolls. These expendable items are about 100 cp each and allow limited spell casting. Some Imps allow characters to start with Materia, and even an Artifact is not out of the question if it makes for a good game. Starting Gear . | One normal weapon of your choice . | One normal armor of your choice . | A tool or item needed for your Class. | Memento or trinket reflecting your Origin. | Traveling clothes in your style. | Backpack (bedroll, small cup, 10m rope, flint &amp; steel, chalk, snacks counting as one ration, a torch, large sack, water skin or canteen). | Dagger or Knife (same stats). | 500 (or 2d4x100) copper pieces (“cp”). | . Encumbrance . An adventurer can only carry so much, especially returning from a lucrative outing. Each significant burden counts as one or more units of Load. This is based on how many hands it would take for an average person to carry the item. One can bear up to Str + End in Load before becoming Encumbered. This means it now takes two Moves to cross a single Zone. If carrying more than twice Str + End, they are Incapacitated instead. This scales with Size, so what would be held in one hand for a human-sized character may not even count for a giant, and vice-versa. | Load 0 items can usually fit into a pocket or small purse. A single hand could hold several or many. For example, a dagger or herb packet. | Load 1 items are anything an average person can easily carry in one hand; a sword, shield, waterskin, bag of about 1000 coins, etc. | Load 2 items require both hands for an average person. A spear, two-handed weapon, or longbow would apply. | Load 3 or higher items are best carried on one’s back. | . Successful adventures, especially longer ones, will call for good resource management. Swim (Move) Checks are at -1 for each Load. COMMON LOADS . | Item | Load | . | Backpack, small &amp; filled with gear. | 1 | . | Backpack, large &amp; filled with gear. | 2 | . | Bag of coins, 1000 cp or so. | 1 | . | Body, Medium (man-sized) | 4 | . | Body, Small (dog, small child, etc.) | 2 | . | Body, Large (Horse, ogre, etc.) | 8 | . Adventurers may ditch bulky items such as backpacks or sacks of gold before a fight to avoid encumbrance. This does not take an Action but picking it back up does. Likewise, a fleeing party may distract pursuers by dropping food or precious items. It may help to write down items in a container on an index card as if the card was the container. If a character trades or drops the container, the player can pass the card to easily transfer the lot. ",

She is a level 10 starting character with standard gear, except for where the player added minor items to indulge ideas about her background.

Instead of writing a backstory, her player has woven this tale using the character sheet itself. When she escaped, the angry dragon destroyed her village as retribution, so she devoted her life to fighting dragons.

    "content": "Characters in Eldritch Gambit improve gradually with play. Players earn XP for their characters by sharing Highlights of the last game or achieving a personal Quest. The point of earning XP is to buy a higher Level: Levels raise when the character has as many XP as their current Level. The player then erases the spent XP, keeping any leftovers. A new Level means a new point in any Attribute, but you may only raise an Attribute to half your Level. Apply these Attribute raises at any time - it can be dramatic to save the day by powering up in the throes of a tense combat scene! . No one is doomed by their advancement choices. The group can always work together later to revise unsatisfactory Concepts, Skills, or Attributes. Highlights XP . At the start of every game after the first, the Imp asks each player in turn for a favorite Highlight of the last session. Any half-decent answer gets an XP. This question goes around the table three times, for up to three XP per player. A short session may call for two, and a long one may call for four chances. For their Highlight, each player recounts their character’s favorite deed last session, heroic or not. A player who gets stuck may ask others for help. To spice things up, the Imp may demand the final round of Highlights be for something another character did. This encourages the players to pay more attention to each other. Highlights are not just a tool for the player. Imps should pay attention as they reveal what the Players enjoyed most. Likewise, if they bring up too few, they may not be getting enough chances to shine or would like to do something differently. Quest XP . Rising to the challenge of a personal quest is a hallmark of fantasy adventure. They are also a double-or-nothing gamble to get more XP! After Highlights XP, Players can bid or Invest one XP in their character’s Quest. If they accomplish it, they get double the invested XP back! If they abandon the Quest for another, they get nothing. Quests are also vital for making some magic items. A long Quest may accumulate XP over several sessions, resulting in either an enormous payout or a tragic loss. A more manageable strategy is to keep the big goal in mind but set up smaller, more do-able Quests as steps toward it. Players should invent Quests that mesh well with their current situation and make the game more fun and exciting for others. XP . ",

On the other hand, they are just standing examples of such fiat rulings and not meant to be restrictive. | Get Them Thinking: an easy yes overall. “XP for discovery and adversity” is mixed, as players could give their characters XP for just about anything. As a result there is no strict XP-for-treasure. Just the lack of XP-for-Treasure is enough for many to discount this from being an OSR entirely. | Player Ingenuity over Character Ability: also fits the spirit of the game. Materia, Ephemera, and Artifacts make for unique and interesting tools to aid clever solutions to problems, and are not a fixed part of the character. | Build Rocks and Hard Places while mostly a feature of the adventure, tough choices are coded in with the idea of Gambits, Staggers, the timing of actions such as Rallies, etc. On the other hand, it is much looser on keeping track of time, ammo, and distance than some tables like. | Dice with Death: Eldritch Gambit is a low-HP game, moreso than many strict OSRs and combat can easily be deadly. There are no resurrection spells aside from plot events or powerful free-form Artifacts. | Be Their World: Eldritch Gambit avoids perception/notice Checks like the plague, in favor of just generously describing what is there. It also supports the idea of collaborative worldbuilding and a world that moves on its own. | . So yes on most points, mixed on others. ",

    "title": "Rolls",
    "content": "Make a Roll when you just need a number within a certain range. Rolls are for inflicting damage, spell effects, and a great many other things. These use the d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12 dice, as below: . Modifiers . A positive or negative number called a Modifier may alter Roll results. For example, a 1d8+3 roll would give a result of 4-11. A Roll can be modified by the relevant Attribute plus the largest Bonus (+) and the largest Penalty (-). This can reduce the result to zero but not into the negatives. Normally, bonuses do not stack with other bonuses and penalties do not stack with other penalties. All you need to consider is the Attribute used (if any!) and the largest bonus and/or penalty. Modifier = Attribute + Bonus + Penalty . Sometimes you will halve or double the result of a Roll. If halved, always round up. Roll-offs . This is when two Rolls oppose each other, a common situation during feats of might or size. The highest result is the winner, the lowest is the loser, and ties go to the attacker. Roll-offs decide clash damage and the winner of Grapples. Rerolls . A Reroll is when a player or Imp picks up a die Roll result they do not like and rolls it again, choosing the best result. If the result is the same, add the two! Rerolling costs a temporary Willpower (WP, point. One may only spend a single WP on a given Roll and cannot Reroll Checks. ",

    "title": "Checks",
    "content": "Certain actions can either succeed or fail, such as aiming at a foe, looking for clues to a treasure, convincing villagers not to burn them alive, etc. Make a Check in these dramatic situations. This calls on fate and talent to decide between a good and bad outcome, based on what the player says their character is doing. To make a Check, roll 1d20 plus the relevant Attribute , then add any modifiers. Adventurers are broadly competent and get a d20 for vital feats such as Attack and Grapple. Other actions require a relevant OCS, standing for Origin Class, or Skill . If they do not have it, they use 1d12 instead. If the total result is at or above the action’s Difficulty Factor (DF, usually 10) it is a success, and the “good” outcome occurs. If below, it is a failure and the “bad” one occurs. If not obvious, the Imp may explain the outcomes beforehand. Modifiers apply to Checks just as they do for Rolls. DIFFICULTIES . | DF | Narrative Difficulty | . | 5 | Routine | . | 10 | Challenging | . | 15 | Daunting | . | 20 | Formidable | . | 25+ | Nigh impossible | . For example, trying to catch a falling potion might be a Check of 1d20 +Dex vs. DF 10. The good outcome could be “you catch the potion safely, just inches off the ground” and the bad one could be “it shatters, the precious liquid sinking into the earth.” . A “natural” or “raw” result of one; before any modifier, always fails. A natural twenty always succeeds. These results are otherwise no better or worse than usual. Whether a result is better or worse relies on Gambits, below. A d12 Check always succeeds on a 12 instead, due to beginners’ luck. The Imp should not humor utterly impossible acts, and the players should find other means to move forward. On the other hand, trivial actions that are highly likely to succeed should simply do so. Part of playing the Imp is learning where to draw this line. Gambits . Mere success or failure is not the only possible outcome of a Check. A player may also call for a Gambit after throwing the dice, pushing their luck by re-rolling for a better result. After success, succeeding again results in a triumphant Critical, while failing means they have now merely failed. After Failure, succeeding on the Gambit turns it into a Success while failing again reveals a ruinous Botch. See the next page for useful Critical &amp; Botch ideas. The same Modifiers and dice apply to the Gambit as the original Check, and one can only Gambit once per Check. WP Rerolls do not apply to Checks, so you cannot spend them on a Gambit either. | Critical is a success with benefits. For example, a Critical to pick a lock might halve the time, while a Critical attack may add damage. | Botch is a failure with a painful drawback or twist. For example, a Botch to persuade someone may also ruin your relationship, while a Botched attack might result in a dropped weapon. | . Other players can chime in with possible outcomes. To keep this fun from getting too sadistic, the Scenes chapter gives default Criticals and Botches for many popular actions. These defaults are a valid resort for either the Player or Imp if they cannot reach an agreement quickly. Once either chooses a default, the game moves on. Gambits are optional! However, players who dare to use them will understand the heart of this game long before their more cautious fellows. STANDARD CRITICALS . | Critical | Effect | . | Ahead of Schedule | Takes around half the time it normally would. | . | Assist Ally | Turn an ally’s Failure or Botch into a Success. | . | Bonus Damage | Add max of one die as bonus to the damage Roll. | . | Conserve Resources | Costs about half the usual materials or coin. | . | Hinder foe | Turn a foe’s Success or Critical into a Failure. | . | Leave No Trace | Carefully avoid leaving evidence or clues for opponents to find. | . | Make an Impression | Improve relationship with contact or other important NPC. | . | Super Effective | Has about twice the usual effect or counts as two Successes. | . STANDARD BOTCHES . | Botch | Effect | . | Attract Trouble | Lets anyone nearby know something interesting is going on. | . | Bad Impression | Harm relationship with contact or other important NPC. | . | Countered | Take retaliatory damage or other setback from target. | . | Friendly fire | Harm ally instead of target, target gets to choose which. | . | Fumble | Drop a weapon or other important item in combat, lose it if out of combat. | . | Hinder Ally | Turn an ally’s Success or Critical into a Failure. | . | Stumble | Lose next Action or task takes around twice the time it normally would. | . | Waste | Costs about twice the usual materials or coin. | . Teamwork . You can make a single Check for actions involving an entire group, such as Sneak or Travel. When more people would help, such as intimidation, this is a Strongest-link Check. When more people get in the way, such as sneaking around, it is a Weakest-link Check. | Strongest-link Checks use the best relevant OCS and Attribute out of the group. | Weakest-link Checks use the best OCS but the lowest relevant attribute out of the group. | . For example, a party would enjoy the guidance of their thief when sneaking, but a clumsy (low Agi) ally would still hinder them. Helping Others . Explain how you helped, then grant your own Success to an ally if they Failed or Botched earlier. If you get a Critical, you both succeed. The latter is one of the standard Criticals (Assist ally), below. ",

    "content": "You’ve probably already figured out no one can tell you or your group how to run their own game. The author is not going to smash through your wall and demand you stop having fun wrong. That said, here are some helpful suggestions for Players and Imps to get the most out of Eldritch Gambit. Narrating Actions . How you describe actions is up to you. For example, saying “I attack” is valid, but so is “I bend back my bowstring and let my arrow fly, aiming straight for its wretched eye socket.” See what you enjoy best, but most groups prefer a little spice. Party Conflict . If acting against another PC, avoid hard feelings by letting them describe the outcome of your action. This is as true for gory attacks as for social persuasion. For example, a player whose character is convinced to take the lead may say they do so distrustfully or take precautions. One shot by another player gets to say where and how bad it looks, etc. Keep in mind the Player always stays in control of their character. They can go along, put their own spin on it, or outright refuse to be manipulated! . To Die or not to Die . Rolling dice is fun, but even the prettiest number rocks can lose their magic if you call on their oracular powers too often. Players and Imps alike should think about when to use them, not just how! . First, there is no need to start throwing your dice while the Imp tries to describe what your character encounters. There are no Checks to notice or detect in this game. Sneak Checks are none of your business if you aren’t making them, and Insight Checks only help understand what you see. Instead, you and the Imp get to work together. Ask the right questions to help imagine the situation. Second, instead of asking permission or what you should roll, just boldly proclaim your action. For example, “I leap across the balcony, swinging off the chandelier into the fray!” The Imp and the rest of your table are likely to love it and move on. You may do very well without touching your dice for quite a while. Give them no reason to doubt and see what you can get away with. Sometimes a Player will harbor suspicions about an Imp’s action, and they may call for a Check too. Just like the Imp, they should be careful not to pull this stunt too often. The takeaway here is to let the narration come first, mostly calling on the dice to resolve doubt. ",

    "content": "The following is a short bit of play showcasing Rolls, Rerolls, Checks, and Gambits. Players are using their character’s names and in-character speech is in quotation marks. You will understand the actions they take and the terms they use better as you read further in this book. Petra the Exiled Amazon and Mazzy the Singing Shepherd have just jumped off a cliff onto the back of a giant Wyvern to escape a deadly trio of Gargoyles, as one does. Petra: “Can you fly this thing?” . Mazzy: “You’re the Amazon.” . Petra: “Where did you get it lodged in your noggin that Amazons flew around on these things? Hope you have a better idea in there.” . Mazzy: Oops. I wonder if I can hold on? Ehh no I am going to use a different approach. I’m a charming guy so I’ll make some screeching Wyvern noises and try to calm it… . Imp: creative… but unlikely, so Check. Mazzy rolls a mere d12 as he has no relevant Class, Origin, or Skill. He gets a 2, then adds his +3 Cha for a total of 5. The Wyvern’s WP is 12 so this fails. Bad luck! . Mazzy: If I can’t control it the Gargoyles might catch us. I’m going to use a Gambit; if we fail, I don’t just lose control - the new consequence is the Wyvern will try to throw us off! . Imp: That’s a great consequence, but I’ll lessen it so it will only try to throw Petra off. Petra: Jerk! . This time, Mazzy rolls a 9 for a total of 12. Still low, but just enough to reach the Wyvern’s 12 WP. Imp: Much to your relief, it calms down a little and starts to soar. But it is still skittish, and you know better than to trust the thing. The Gargoyles can fly too, of course, and they are right behind you. Petra: Whew! I would have found a way to take you down with me if I fell, you know. Mazzy: Harsh. I mean I would have saved you somehow… “Ok Petra, you shoot!” . Petra: I level my flame staff on the gargoyle as it swoops in… rolled a 14 plus my Dex of 2 – 16! . Imp: hit him dead on, roll damage. Petra: ok, the flame stave does 1d12, +1 for my Charisma…and it’s a 2? Ugh. I spend a WP and Reroll the 2… that’s a 10, so now it’s 11 damage. Wow, I am on fire tonight! . Imp: …and so is the Gargoyle. Eleven is over its HP so it drops out of the sky trailing smoke. One of the other Gargoyles swoops down to try and catch it. The third and last one glares at you, enraged, but it also flies off. Mazzy: Weird. That is not how I thought this sort of monster would act. Petra: Yeah, they really seem to look out for each other. I wonder what that is about? . ",

    "title": "Templates",
    "content": "Every character has a Template to describe their basic form as well as how they are different from a human. A Template a set of helpful or harmful Traits; animal, monstrous, or alien. This method handles transformations, body-swapping, mutations, curses, and other strangeness with little fuss. Traits are treated as special equipment that cannot be removed, for better or worse. As such, they inflict or relieve Load, as in the Encumbrance section. Traits with positive Load are advantages, those with zero Load balance out, and negatives relieve Load. Creatures with many abilities and few drawbacks pay for it with a lot of innate Load. This means fantastic creatures like dragons tend not to carry around a lot of stuff. Aside from the obvious metabolic strain, it is hard to fit a backpack over dorsal spines and giant wings. Many of the Traits below may give unstated benefits or drawbacks. For example, a character with the Size (Small) Trait would be able to fit through tight openings and such without saying so explicitly. Size . Fantasy fights often involve wildly mismatched opponents - giants vs. dwarves, elves vs. elephants, knights vs. windmills, etc. Each size step is a huge increase in height and weight. Creatures with a Size larger than human get more HP to account for this. This has diminishing returns at larger sizes, as their weak points and vitals are also larger targets. Str modifiers reflect lesser differences within a Size category, such as between breeds of horses. Size does not affect the Str Attribute itself. Instead, it changes the dice for damage and Rallies. For example, a medium-sized character with +1 Str and a dagger does 1d6+1 damage, a large one does 2d6+1, and a small one does 1d4+1. A Critical works as usual, adding the max of one die to the Roll. In this case, the medium-sized character would do 1d6+7, the large one 2d6+7, and the small one 1d4+5. Load for carried gear is scaled to human size. If it comes up, you can use the Rolls column to scale Load for other Sizes. A Tiny creature would count 1 Load as 3, a Large one would count 2 Load as 1, and so on. SIZES . | Size | Rolls* | HP** | Example | . | Tiny | 2 smaller | - | Mouse | . | Small | 1 smaller | - | Cat | . | Medium | 1d | - | Human | . | Large | 2d | x2 | Horse | . | Huge | 3d | x3 | Rhino | . | Giant | 4d | x4 | Elephant | . | Titanic | 5d | x5 | Whale | . * before adding Str (damage) or End (Rally). ** also applies to AP (Armor Points) . The Tiny and Small Sizes reduce die to a smaller type. For example, d12 to d10 is one smaller while d8 to d4 would be two. This can take a d4 down to uncommon die sizes: d3 (d6/2) or d2 (d4/2). While larger Size can be a big advantage, it can also make it harder to use cover, entrances, mounts, clothes, or vehicles made for smaller folks. Falling does more damage to larger creatures, raising the damage by their HP multiple in the table above. LIST OF TRAITS . | Amorphous: a body with no solid form, such as a slime or amoeba. Those with this Trait take half damage from attacks without an Element, such as most physical weapons. They can also squooze through small openings, which takes one Move Action per Size difference between the creature and the opening. Larger worn items might not be able to pass through with them. | Armored: covered in a leathery hide, scaly plates, force fields, thick fur, etc. There are four levels of this (light, medium, heavy, ultra), matching the types of armor available as gear. This includes the usual Rally die type increase from armor. | Attack: claws, teeth, horns, breath weapons, spurs, stingers, etc. Different types (Close, Strike, Reach, etc.) reflect the diversity of natural attacks. Size applies to the damage dice used, and Elements can be chosen just as with Spells. | Bane: harmed by something harmless to most humans, like a vampire turning to ash in sunlight or a werewolf’s weakness to silver. Rare banes like silver are -1 Load, while something common like sunlight is -2. Exposure inflicts the Burning Status, meaning they cannot Rally and take 1d6 damage per Round. | Climb: a body made for climbing such as a squirrel, caterpillar, or monkey. This halves the DF on Move Checks to climb obstacles or scale foes. | Drain (Template): absorb the life force of others. If Staggered, they may immediately clear this Status by inflicting the Fallen status on a living victim of the chosen Template. the draining attack must use either an unarmed bite or other specific method. | Explosive: explodes when defeated. Fallen creatures with this Trait die instantly but inflict 1d8+Str damage to all in the same Zone. Size affects these dice as usual. | Fast: can run amazingly fast, like a horse or a cheetah. Add a Zone of Move for each Load, with finer differences in speed reflected by their Agi. | Flammable: catches fire easily when exposed to an open flame, common for dusty undead or things made of wood or paper. If hit with a Fire Element or otherwise exposed to flame, they suffer the Burning status. | Flight: the creature has wings or other powers allowing them to fly freely. They may Move two Zones in any direction, negate falls if conscious, and ignore most obstacles. | Graspless: lacks hands or fine manipulators and cannot wield most weapons or tools. | Immobile: cannot Move effectively on their own and do not get a Move or Free Move. | Innate Spell: the creature can cast a certain Spell without Learning it or using a Materia or Ephemera. This can be taken multiple times for different Spells. This is good for magical creatures or gifted humans. | Jump: the creature has strong legs or other apparatus enabling amazing leaps. The character may use their Move to leap an entire Zone upwards or two across. This also halves fall damage and the difficulty of overcoming most obstacles. | Keen Smell &amp; Hearing: sensitive ears and nose, like those of a dog or elephant. Always count as alert and face only half DF for Insight Checks reliant on smell or hearing. | Keen Vision: sharp eyes like those of a hawk or mantis shrimp. Always count as Alert and face only half DF for Insight Checks reliant on vision. | Mimicry: the creature can change their outward form to seem like another object or creature. Nearly indistinguishable from the original, they halve their Sneak DF if fittingly disguised. | Nightvision: see perfectly well in the dark, like a cat or other nocturnal hunter. This negates visibility penalties for darkness unless entirely pitch black, such as a well-sealed room or deep cavern. | Regeneration: a healing factor or a strange body type that springs back quickly from injury. Their Recovery Checks are at half DF. | Resistance: insulating fur against cold, a ceramic shell to protect from heat, etc. An Element like Fire, Cold, Void, etc. or weapon quality like Stun, Area effect, etc. must be chosen. This means they can easily weather certain climates and halve damage coming from that Element. | Shifter: the creature can change into another form as part of their Rally action. Make a new Template for the alternate form. If the other form does not also have the Transform Trait, it is one-way, and they cannot shift back! | Size: difference in Size when compared to a human. This alters HP and damage/rally dice. Details are given in the Size paragraph above . | Skeletal: having no flesh means cutting and piercing weapons are less effective. Physical attacks made by weapons without the Stun feature do half damage. They also sink like a stone in water, facing double DF when swimming. | Slow: like a slug or sloth. It takes two Move Actions to move one Zone. | Speechless: cannot use spoken language as we know it, limited to basic grunts or calls. | Stretch: a long appendage or stretchy limbs reach all the way into adjacent Zones. These can take Actions or make Melee Attacks as if they were in the next Zone. Obstacles lessened by reaching to or over them present half their usual DF. | Undead: an animate corpse. Undead are immune to Poison, Disease, and Deprivation but cannot make Recovery Checks. Many undead also have the Drain Trait to get around this limitation. | Unstable: it is possible to dispel or undo the magic that animates the creature. A Dispel will kill them outright if successful. This Dispel is at d12 unless the caster has the Spell that animated them or is using the Purge Spell. | Venomous: an insidious venom like that of a snake, platypus, or scorpion. This applies to a specific damaging Attack, whether unarmed or with a natural weapon. The poison is lethal with a 1d6 Buildup per round. Each extra Load adds a dose to the attack. | Vulnerability: overly affected by the elements. Choose an Element tag like Fire, Cold, Void, etc. or weapon quality like Stun, Area effect, etc. for each Vulnerability taken. This means they have a hard time in related climates and take double damage from that Element or weapon quality. | . Sentient Animals . A common theme in fantasy stories and settings, especially as victims of transformation magic. Animal characters choose or roll Attributes as normal. If they have human intelligence, they should also choose an OCS that shows it, just like a human character. If the animal form normally has the Speechless or Graspless Traits, those may be bought off as Load. Non-human PCs . Settings often have non-human or demi-human options, like elves, dwarves, androids, minotaurs, etc. This is easy enough to do just by creating a Template for them. If they have strong innate leanings toward certain Attributes, it is enough to say the favored Attribute should not be their lowest. Mutant Casters . Clever human characters, or at least their players, might figure out they can cast Spells without Materia or Ephemera if they change their Templates to include Innate Spell. Artifacts may exist that allow permanent changes to their form. Arguably, changing their Template makes them no longer purely human, and they must deal with the resulting Load and whatever identity crises result. Occasionally, a gifted human is born who can cast Spells on their own via the Innate Spell Trait. This usually causes them more than their fair share of problems.

    "content": "To make things easier on Imps, un-named NPCs do not need a full set of Attributes. Instead, they get a Threat rating consisting of two numbers divided by a plus or minus sign, i.e., “2+1” or “5+3.” . The first part of a Threat rating is their Base, which replaces Attributes on Checks and Rolls. Add 10 and you a DF that forms their WP and AF. Multiply by 5 to get HP. Not all NPCs with a Threat rating are dangerous, but they could be. The second part is their current Load from gear or special abilities. This factor drastically influences the danger involved in facing them. The max current Load is Base x 2, so it is not unusual to see creatures with Load higher than their Threat Base. This should only be for gear or Traits, do not count benign burdens like gold or backpacks for this. THREAT . | Base | DF | HP | Max Load | Level | . | 1 | 11 | 5 | 2 | 4-7 | . | 2 | 12 | 10 | 4 | 8-11 | . | 3 | 13 | 15 | 6 | 12-15 | . | 4 | 14 | 20 | 8 | 16-19 | . | 5 | 15 | 25 | 10 | 20-23 | . | 6 | 16 | 30 | 12 | 24-27 | . …and so on. While un-named (Threat-level) NPCs get a WP score to resist mental and social Checks, they cannot normally spend WP. Named NPCs and some unique monsters still use full Attribute sets like a PC. If you need to convert, every four full Levels is worth about 1 Threat Base, and vice-versa. This is shown in the last column of the Threat table above, for reference. OSR Conversions . One way to convert creatures from Old School Revival (OSR) and similar games is to let the total of Threat and Load stand in for a creature’s “HD.” For example a creature from a bestiary with 7 HD might have a Base of 4 and 3 Load from Traits, or any other combination. In practice and across all sorts of RPGs, there is no truly accurate scheme for comparing power levels. This will give you a place to start cross-game comparisons, however. ",

    "content": "The section to follow presents a smattering of classic fantasy NPCs including creatures, people, and monsters. These make it easy to run a typical adventure and to guide you in making NPCs for your own setting. This is not a detailed bestiary; it is only a set of convenient examples to get you going. For unnamed NPCs, the title of each entry is their Template, with their Class behind a comma. For example, “Human, Peasant.” This gives them a d20 on anything they should know relating to either. For example, a “Squirrel” would get a d20 on gathering nuts, chattering, and scurrying but not for translating ancient languages or lying about gods. Only named or unique NPCs get a full and specific PC writeup with Quest, Origin, Skills, etc. The following entries show creatures at their typical Threat. Imps may always boost them to portray elite examples of their ilk or even just to nudge them up to an appropriate level for the setting or adventure. Babblin . Threat: 1+1 Base: +1 DF: 11 HP: 5 Rally: 1d4+1 Size: Medium Move: 1 Attacks: . | Claws &amp; Teeth: (Hit +2, 1d6+1 dmg) | Spell (Confuse): Check +1 vs. WP to Confuse. | . Defenses: none Template: Babblin [Attack (close), Innate Spell (Confuse), Speechless]. Gear: torn clothing . These gibbering reptilian monsters endlessly seek an unknown Artifact, perhaps to reverse their hideous transformation. In combat, they use their Confuse Spell to set their target babbling as well, then rend the delirious victims with their claws and teeth. Creep Candle . Threat: 1-3 Base: +1 DF: 11 HP: 5 Rally: 1d3+1 Size: Small Move: ½ (Slow) Attacks: . | Digestion: Hit +1, ½d4+1 (2-3) dmg | Explosion (at &lt;0 HP): 1d3+1 dmg to Zone | . Defenses: none Template: Lambent Polyp [Explosive, Climb, Size(small), Slow, Speechless, Graspless] Gear: none, random animal bones. Glowing puffballs drawn toward the warmth of the living; they provide light but get underfoot. If killed, they explode in a cloud of spores and gravel. Mostly a nuisance to adventurers trying to rest, as the unwary may wake up covered in them. Dragon, young . Threat: 4+6 Base: +4 DF: 14 HP: 50 Rally: 2d6+4 Size: Large Move: 1 Attacks: . | Bite/Claw: (Hit +2, 2d6+5 dmg, Grapple) | Fiery Breath: (2d6+5 Fire dmg to Zone, Rng 2) | . Defenses: Scaly hide (5AP), Resist Fire (½ dmg). Template: Dragon, young [Size (large), Flight, Armor (light), Resistance (Fire), Vulnerability (Cold), Attack (close), Attack (ranged area, Fire)]. Gear: none on them, but there is probably 1d12 x 1000 cp of starter loot hidden away somewhere. Immature and arrogant. Only the size of a large horse, but eager to make their scorch mark on the world. In combat, they like to first pick off stragglers then use their fiery breath on those who bunch up in a group for protection. Grue . Threat: 3+2 Base: +3 DF: 13 HP: 30 Rally: 2d6+3 Size: Large Move: 1 Attacks: . | Maul: (Hit +4, dmg 2d6+3) | . Defenses: none Template: Grue [Nightvision, Attack(close), Size(large), Bane(light)] Gear: none . An unseen devourer in the darkness that stalks intruders. Many say they do not exist and are only waking nightmares, and this is at least partly true. Their shadowy forms will flicker away when exposed to light, each unfortunate witness seeing a different umbral form. Horse, Riding . Threat: 2+1 Base: +2 DF: 12 HP: 20 Rally: 2d4+2 Size: Large Move: 2 Attacks: . | Kick: (Hit +3, 2d4+2 dmg) | . Defenses: none Template: Horse [Fast, Size (large), Speechless, Graspless] Gear: saddle, bridle, horseshoes. Speedy and self-sufficient, horses are commonly ridden by adventurers and are a great aid to long journeys, halving travel times in friendly terrain. If they cannot run from a fight, they can trample or kick with their hooves. They can also wear barding, which acts as Armor of its type. Human, Librarian . Threat: 1+0 Base: +1 DF: 11 HP: 5 Rally: 1d4+1 Size: Medium Move: 1 Attacks: . | Dagger (Hit +2, 1d6+1 dmg, Rng 1) | . Defenses: none Template: Human Gear: librarian robes, 3d6 cp. Librarians keep themselves busy knowing where books are and shushing noisy adventurers. The job attracts those who are intelligent, detail-oriented, and reverent of musty old tomes. Human, Zombie . Threat: 1-2* Base: +1 DF: 11 HP: 5 Rally: 1d4+1 Size: Medium Move: 1 Attacks: \\ . | Bite (Hit +0, 1d4+1 dmg) | . Defenses: none Template: Human [Undead, Unstable] Gear: rotting clothes, *or as in life if recently raised. Risen to a mockery of life by foul necromancy, these creatures are doomed echoes of their former selves. In combat, Zombies will grapple and bite. Though it is a terrible waste, those given weapons and even magic items can still use them. Mimic . Threat: 3+0 Base: +3 DF: 13 HP: 15 Rally: 1d4+3 Size: Medium Move: 1 Attacks: . | Toothy maw: (Hit +5, 1d6+6 dmg, Grapple) | . Defenses: Mimicry Template: Mimic [Mimicry, Attack (close), Speechless] Gear: 1-20 cp in the mimic, another 1-100 cp worth of treasure scattered as bait. Mimics lie in wait disguised as carrion or treasure, then spring to life and devour their greedy victims. A mimic makes a Sneak Check at half DF when adventurers arrive. They seem just as happy to Attack if spotted beforehand, however. The loot the mimic used as a model is often nearby. Noodler . Threat: 1+0 Base: +1 DF: 11 HP: 5 Rally: 1d4+1 Size: Medium Move: 1 Attacks: . | Grapple: Hit +2, 1d4+1 dmg, Range 1 due to Stretch) | . Defenses: Amorphous (½ physical dmg) Flammable, Vulnerability (2x Fire dmg) Template: Noodler [Amorphous, Stretch, Flammable, Vulnerability (Fire)] Gear: torn clothing . These slender, ropy figures slip in and out of tiny cracks in caverns, dungeons, and ruins. Some say they were once human, others wriggling conspiracies of worms. Perhaps they are both, now. Whatever they are possesses an animal cunning, leading them to wait by traps to feed on the remains of the unwary. ",

    "title": "Setting Design",
    "content": "There are many approaches to designing a setting for your gaming group. Groups typically use an existing setting, a custom setting, a random setting, or a collaborative setting. | Existing Settings are based on prior stories, such as from books, comics, manga, television, movies, even other RPGS. Freeform character creation is ideal for this, but you may need to adjust things, like how magic works. | Random Settings are based on die rolls or other methods and can result in truly unusual worlds. You can use the seed prompts below , find a random world generator online, flip through a dictionary, consult a tarot deck, or use the cut-up technique as inspiration. | Custom Settings are authored by someone, usually the Imp running the game. They already have strong ideas about the world and do not need much from this guide. Like an existing setting, the work involves checking to see if the rules of Eldritch Gambit mesh well with their creative vision. | Collaborative Settings are made bit by bit, using input from the entire table. This includes the Imp as well as the Players! This seems daunting but with the right group it can be lots of fun and result in a world everyone is invested in. | . Many settings are combinations of the above, so feel free to mix and match. The following text focuses on collaborative settings, as they need more explanation. If you don’t want to try collaboration, just stick to the other, more traditional options. Brainstorming . Collaborative settings are largely built “on the fly” by listening to the ideas of your gaming group. Imps who go this route need to surrender some of their authority over the content of the game to the Players. This can be difficult and is not for all groups. Start small, plot out a local village, city, or a dungeon instead of a whole world. You can always collaborate again to grow new areas. Base your design on the broad fantasies Eldritch Gambit was made for. Tell your players this is a “fantasy” setting, where the key elements are danger, adventure, and personal quests. These themes are intuitive, interesting, and popular in fantasy media so this should not be hard to sell as a starting point. Next, ask for ideas about the area your group wants to play in. You might want a whiteboard or other means for everyone to see the ideas all at once. Start by writing down an idea of your own, then go around the table, asking each Player for one thing they would like to see. Tell them these should be constructive ideas – if they have an idea about something they truly don’t want, they should suggest an alternative as well. You can do this for several rounds but avoid going over three. If an idea is not acceptable to any player, just cross it off the list. If this causes a bitter argument, your group may have underlying problems getting along with each other. Talk it out or try another setting design method (existing, custom, random). This is a blessing in disguise, as it is better to find out here than halfway through a campaign. It is no failure to opt out of a collaborative setting and go back to the other tried-and-true methods. For example, the players may want things like “Sandworms” and “Flying Islands” or “Betrayals” but may veto “dwarves” or “sado-masochism” or tropes like “shadowy strangers handing out missions.” . Treat this as a creative aid rather than a contract. You can always use your limited power as an Imp to influence how these ideas are expressed in the story. After laying out the big picture, you and your group can turn to the setting sheet and start filling things in based on the ideas you generated. Setting Sheet . Just like players get a Character Sheet, Imps get a Setting Sheet. This is intentionally designed for a small area to start with. Share this with the Players, as this gives them an easy intro or cheat sheet. It has fields for the name or title, a brief overview, what is currently going on, what they should know, and a legend for the most interesting spots on the map. If you are working on a Collaborative Setting, your Players have a lot of input on how each of the boxes on this sheet turn out. If you have too many good suggestions (oh no!), hold a vote. With the other methods, these are primarily the Imp’s responsibility. Title . Here is where you put a few words to serve as a name. This should convey what is compelling about the area you are playing in. As with characters, setting names can be surprisingly difficult. Do not be surprised if you end up deciding this last. One way to title the setting is to name it after its most notable feature, like a huge mountain or desert. If you need more inspiration, roll on the initials table back in the character creation section. Examples: Esterossa of the Thousand Geysers, The Dragon-marked Wastes of Thaal, the Emerald Vale of the Sandworms, etc. Overall Theme . What is it all about? This is for describing the most meaningful features of your setting, whether it is an entire world, a city, or a dungeon. There is not much space here, and this is intentional. These limits help focus what you are trying to get across. This may be influenced by the setting suggestions your group came up with earlier. You can start with a sentence and fill in more details later. Examples: A blasted wasteland filled with the mysterious ruins of an ancient civilization, a lush forest populated by spider-riding elves, a floating island doomed to fall when its Idyll tree withers, a meaty railroad for tiny sentient mites etched out on the back of an unhappy goat, a living dungeon held aloft by four guardian giants, etc. OVERALL THEME SEEDS . | D20 |   | . | 1 | Chaos – uncontrolled and vibrant. | . | 2 | Crime – injustice, subterfuge, and violence. | . | 3 | Doom – facing down an encroaching end. | . | 4 | Dreams – illusion, oracle, or imagination. | . | 5 | Excess – decadent wealth or uniformity. | . | 6 | Glory – enjoying the summit of existence. | . | 7 | Hope – seeking out a promised future. | . | 8 | Horror – touched by a force of terror. | . | 9 | Lack – in dire need of a vital resource. | . | 10 | Lost – unknown, forbidden, or deserted. | . | 11 | Mystery – a piece of the puzzle is missing. | . | 12 | Nature – the law of the wilds prevails. | . | 13 | Order – rigidly bound and controlled. | . | 14 | Peace – whether by pacifism or victory. | . | 15 | Progress – the march of civilization. | . | 16 | Ruin – shattered or decayed beyond repair. | . | 17 | Sacrifice – something has to go, to go on. | . | 18 | Strife – locked in struggle or war. | . | 19 | Toil – kept aloft only by strenuous effort. | . | 20 | Weird – eccentric and disturbing. | . Current Events . What is there to do? This is a section to state outright what conflicts and current events exist. Think of them like the chyrons on a very biased news channel, giving concise but dramatic interpretations of the events of the day. This gives players a clear idea what there is to do, even if it is a “sandbox” setting largely up to their own whims. In a living world, these should change as things develop. In the best of cases, these may change if the characters make a mark on the game world! . Examples: the Dark Lord’s army is advancing on Ogrefell, the Tatzelwurm catch was unusually light this year, a second sun has appeared and is driving the animals mad, a new tree of life has sprouted from a dormant volcano, etc. CURRENT EVENT SEEDS . | D20 |   | . | 1 | Celebration – it’s that time of year again. | . | 2 | Crime wave – fraud, theft, murder, etc. | . | 3 | Disaster – a natural or unnatural tragedy. | . | 4 | Eureka! – a new idea brings change. | . | 5 | Famine – starvation and hoarding. | . | 6 | Fugitives – feared folks are afoot. | . | 7 | Gold rush – resources attract attention. | . | 8 | Invaded – a hostile external force. | . | 9 | Invading – conquering another place. | . | 10 | Miracle – something amazing happens. | . | 11 | Missing – a crucial person or thing is gone. | . | 12 | Plague – disease, vermin, or bad ideas. | . | 13 | Politics – it’s time to choose sides. | . | 14 | Rampage – big and bold troublemaker(s). | . | 15 | Ransom – a hostage and demands. | . | 16 | Rebellion – an internal struggle or coup. | . | 17 | Scandal – a VIP did something naughty. | . | 18 | Scapegoat – someone to blame for it all. | . | 19 | Surplus – cornucopia &amp; complications. | . | 20 | Whodunit – a big case needs solving. | . Map . This is a small grid map for sketching out the setting. This does not need to be in scale. The example map above is drawn as a point-crawl. Each highlighted point or area is within a circle, and the lines between show how many days it takes to travel between them. You may sketch things out more loosely than this at first, or as a different style of map. The numbers to the left and bottom of the map are for placing areas of interest randomly. To do this, simply roll two d10s. This gives two numbers from 0-9 to use as coordinates for placing names on the map. The die roll cannot fill the edges of the map randomly; if you want something there you must place it there on purpose. If two rolled areas overlap, reroll it or think up a clever explanation. For example, if you roll up a city on the same square, maybe the city has two distinct levels; one on top of the other, or maybe they exist in two different dimensions. Maybe two factions are in a fight for its identity, or they are just close neighbors. Take the prompt and run with it. Common Knowledge . What does everyone know? This is a few (3-5) interesting, useful, and flavorful facts or rumors most people in the setting would know. These bits of lore would mark one as a stranger if they were not aware of them. “Everyone knows…” This helps the Players grasp what it is like to live in this setting and what is unique about it. This is not necessarily “lore.” Just because everyone knows something to be true does not mean it is! As with the others, change these when the world changes or when you want to put new ideas into the heads of your players. Examples: witches turn you into toads if you ask them a question, Good Queen Slaughterama controls the world through her monopoly on scented soap, there is a cold war between the northern and western kingdoms, no one goes into the southern wastes because they are haunted, everyone wants to be a dragon knight, etc. Legend . Where can you explore? Here is where you can list interesting places for the characters to visit. If you are using a point-crawl map, you should put each point here at least. These are inspirations for adventure! Do not waste a legend entry on anything boring or on anything you do not want to explore with your players. In the space it gives, you should be able to provide a taste of what they would know as well as why it is interesting. Examples: Filth-encrusted lair of the 2-star bandit, Sinkhole that devoured the Lost city of Trang, Dungeon of Delirium, Tracks of the Leviathan, secret passage to the treasure room, etc. Adventures . When you have your setting started, the next step is to play in it. You and your players will have to strike their own balance between a free-form sandbox style of play and one guided by prepared events. Either way, it is good to have some ideas of the trouble your party can get into. Find a wealth of inspiration for these plots in fantasy movies, books, comics, manga, anime, etc. Some fun tropes are listed below: . ADVENTURE SEEDS . | D20 |   | . | 1 | Avert a looming disaster. | . | 2 | Build a movement, army, or business. | . | 3 | Chase down a fugitive or foe. | . | 4 | Deliver an important letter or package. | . | 5 | Destroy or obtain a dangerous Artifact. | . | 6 | Distract enemies to cover for allies. | . | 7 | Escape from prison or a dire situation. | . | 8 | Escort a caravan over an unsafe route. | . | 9 | Explore a new and mysterious place. | . | 10 | Find clues to solve a mystery. | . | 11 | Guard someone or something from foes. | . | 12 | Hunt for a vast and fabled treasure. | . | 13 | Infiltrate or spy on a dangerous foe. | . | 14 | Keep a dangerous secret hidden. | . | 15 | Provide aid during an emergency. | . | 16 | Rescue someone from their captor(s). | . | 17 | Sort out a complicated disagreement. | . | 18 | Survive against mounting danger. | . | 19 | Take part in a war or conflict. | . | 20 | Uncover evidence of a nefarious plot. | .

    "title": "Advice",
    "content": "You can find heaps of general advice for running an RPG anywhere, so this mostly specific advice for Eldritch Gambit. The most general advice I can give is to always remember your Imp “power” comes from the Players. If you abuse it, they might not show up for the next one. Try to be fun and fair, but if you do nothing else, at least be their fan. The Imp Loop . Like Players, the Imp gets helpful procedures to follow if they are ever stuck about what to do. If in doubt, describe what the Players are seeing and answer questions about it. They will then either ask more questions or start doing things. If they stall for too long, just ask the central question: . What do you do? . When done, move to the next Scene. IMP LOOP . Session Zero . This is a short session held before the actual game starts or when proposing the game to the group. This helps set expectations about how long the game will last, how often it will take place and when, what kind of events, challenges, or scenarios different players love or hate, and how the group should behave. | Conflict: A popular question is whether players can have their characters attack or kill other player characters. If your group has other ideas, set down how it should work here. | Imp Veto: Make it clear you have veto power over things in the game to keep things fun. This includes settling game-related arguments and expelling problem players if they are ruining the experience for others. | House Rules: If you have made any changes to the rules or added your own, bring them up here. | No, please: unexpected things may dismay players or the Imp and make for a bad session. For example, phobias, traumas, and other triggers. It is better to find out here than during play. | Yes, please: on the upside, ask what the group wants to see in a game. Do they love mysteries or horror? Dark games with a ray of hope? chases? Seek input on this every session if possible. | Snacks: Arguments about food and drink at the table can get surprisingly heated, so it is best to lay these out beforehand. Do you allow alcoholic beverages? Split costs for delivery food, etc.? | Missing Players: if a player does not show, how will their character be handled? Do they get lost or leave for another important errand? Does a trusted player take them as a second? Does the Imp play them as a background NPC? | . Groups may have wildly different ideas of what is important, and long-standing ones may not even need a session zero. Many have taken to using “Safety Tools” like X-cards and questionnaires to avoid scenes that may be unfun or traumatic. These methods are rapidly evolving and can help you avoid trouble. Seek out the best method for your group. Encounters . The Imp gets to set up interesting Encounters for the party to face. These may be monsters, enemies, neutral passerby, strange situations, allies, etc. Some are random and some inevitable. Having a list of random Encounters on hand is extremely useful. After describing the start of the Encounter, ask the Players what they are doing about it. For example, they may want to Sneak past, Parley, Attack, etc. It’s more important to be flexible and allow good ideas here than it is to follow procedure. Adventurers tend to be troublesome and rile up all sorts of Encounters on their own. If not, a good rule of thumb is to spring one after each Montage Scene to keep them from getting complacent. NPCs . The most important parts of a fantasy setting are the aspects your players interact with. In most cases, those things are the people, creatures, and monsters dwelling within it. As the Imp, you can have any number of NPCs. You do not need to work up stats or even a Threat level for every passerby or minion your group faces. Perfectly good Imps often just improvise believable stats as needed. Characters should be able to get a reaction from an NPC. If they are powerless to change them, they have little reason to interact with them at all. If the NPCs have doubts, aims, secrets, and complexities, they have reason to engage them… even if it might “ruin” the story. Care less about your story; they tend to be better when they do not go how you planned. Creatures and Monsters should get similar respect. Every monster is there for a reason and has a past to influence their actions. If you do not ask why, your players will. If that happens, sit back, and let them figure it out. You will be amazed at how inventive they can get undoing your screwups. Arguments . Sometimes players and Imps spend a long time arguing over something that is in the rules or should be (sorry). In this case, the Imp should decide and move on with the game. Fair and fun matters more than right or wrong, and it is not worth robbing everyone’s time and enjoyment fussing over it. Players who still disagree should meet with the Imp afterward about what the rules are or should be. Perception . Communication is confusing enough. It is crucial to let your players know what their characters see outright without gating it behind dice. This is why there are no Checked Actions to “notice” things in this game. When they ask what they see, just tell them! If they search the room, let them find things! . Sneaking and hiding calls for a Check each Scene to stay undetected. Use your best judgment though; if the party opens a barrel, they find the person hiding in it no matter their result. If there is a secret door or trap, give them hints to inspire curiosity. The closest this game gets to a notice or perception Check is the Insight Action. If the Players see something they can use Insight on, you get to reveal something interesting and insightful about it. For example, everyone might see a fresco on the wall, but someone with an artistic or stone working Skill might notice a keyhole in one of the figures. They would not see the keyhole at all if they just walked through. If you still want perception or notice as a Check, you can easily house rule it. Congratulations (or condolences?), you are a game designer now! . Origin, Class, &amp; Skills . Rather than having a set list of abilities to choose from, Eldritch Gambit has free-form ones based on careers, backgrounds, or hobbies. The intent is to encourage abilities that accurately reflect both the imagined character and the living-world setting. One concern is players may abuse this freedom and choose OCS applicable to anything. They could, but specific OCS still work better. Anything too broad, however cunningly worded, backfires if not strongly relevant. This is especially true if other players have more specific ones to compare to. After all this, if you still see a wording as game-breaking, veto it and have the Player make up a better one. It is fine for an Imp to tell a Player their Class or Skill does not apply to a Check. If you think they are stretching it too far, the burden is on the Player to trick you into thinking otherwise. If this causes a lengthy argument, table it for discussion later. Mixing it Up with Checks . Each Action or Montage gives an Attribute that makes sense for it, but this is just a recommendation. If it suits the character’s approach and the demands of the scene, a different Attribute might be better. For example, in a drinking contest to get information from a rowdy bandit camp you would still be using Parley for the outcomes. The relevant OCS would however change to ones suggestive of a high alcohol tolerance (Student, Hold liquor, etc.) and the Attribute would change to End. As an Imp, try to do this when it favors your players rather than using it as a gotcha. Listen carefully for when they want to use alternative Attributes on their own. Failing Forward . In concept this is a simple idea: a failure should still move the story forward somehow. If nothing happens, it can be boring for everyone involved. The classic example is lock-picking, where one can just try and try again with little in the way of consequences. A consequence moving the story forward is better, such as the noise alerting guards or running into a competing group of thieves. You can even suggest a success with cost on a failure, such as managing to get through the lock but destroying it in the process. Gambits play with the idea of falling forward in an interesting way. Using a Gambit on a failure can lead to either a success or a Botch. The Botch result should be both worse and more unlikely. In the lock-picking example, a Botch could break the lockpicks or make so much noise you alerted those inside. If one can just retry a given action, and it is reasonable they would succeed eventually, do not bother with the Check. This goes back to prior advice about not calling for a Check if there is no meaningful consequence for failure. Freeform XP . This method can be freeing for some groups and daunting for others. Imps may fear a perceived loss of control over the direction of the game. “…but what if my players want to do things outside of the spirit of this game?” Unclench. In my experience running and playing in many other games since the early 80s, Players do what they will regardless of how you dole out XP. If you must still look at it as a “reward,” let it be a reward for recounting things the players themselves found fun and worthy. Imps do not actually reward XP in the rules as written. If they did, one could get into the mindset of bribing players into the “right” strategy for playing. This is something players should do on their own. You may feel the urge to reward a good player with XP or rerolls or whatever for doing something cool. Consider rewarding them more directly in the way the scene plays out instead. Some consider this method controversial. If you are one of them and this freeform XP does not work for you, you are more than capable of patching in a more traditional set of rewards from other games. Try to keep them within the same range of XP per session and there should be little trouble. Missing Players . While it is best to have everyone at each game, we all know things do not always work out. You want to reward consistent players without crucifying those who miss a game or two. Missing players can still get their overdue XP by recalling their Highlights from the last session they attended. They can also get a “make-up” XP for each missing session by explaining what their character was up to and how it brings them back into the current events. New Characters . Sometimes a new player joins the group, a character dies, or a player just wants to play a different character. Aside from using a backup or creating one from scratch, painless ways to introduce a new character include having them be the lone survivor of another failed party or an interesting NPC uplifted to PC status. A new character should start at the lowest Level already in the group, at least. A replacement should have the same Level/XP as their old one. Let them choose Weapons, Armor, Spells, and other Items for new or replacement character, as long as they do not outclass the rest of the group or tempt your veto. Lagging Characters . Level differences within a party are expected and not usually a big deal. Sometimes a character may end up with a much lower Level than the rest of the party, however. The Imp may give this character double XP until they catch up with the rest of the group, on the rationale they are learning from their betters. Troubleshooting . As the Imp you want to keep a finger on the pulse of your gaming group so you can adjust things. It’s always good to check in and talk with your players, but often there are things going on that are hard to express. Fortunately, some of the mechanics used in this game also serve as diagnostic tools: . | Gambits: these quickly separate Players into gamblers and those who play it safe. This is fine, you can play without ever touching Gambits! However, if no one is using them, ask yourself if you might be the cause. Are you too hard on them for Botches or too stingy with Criticals? If so, adjust your attitude and make them more appealing. It’s hard to go too far in the forgiving direction. | Willpower: how much visceral struggle is in your game can be revealed by how many Rerolls your players use. Ideally, they should spend some but only rarely to the point of dropping to half. No or little WP spending implies your games may be too inconsequential, too much might mean you were overly harsh. Sometimes that is appropriate for very tense sessions, but if it is too common you might want to dial it back a bit. | Experience: listen when your Players tell you what they deserve XP for, because they are also telling you what they want to see more of. If they cannot think of anything they did to deserve XP, you can help them. If you are both stuck, maybe it is time to open up a conversation about what the group is really looking for in a game. | Fudging: not actually a mechanic, but some Imps feel the dice need help getting the story “right.” If you find you regret the way the dice went and want to “fudge” or change the result, you may be calling on them too much. Try cutting back on the Checks and just saying “yes” more often. If a die result could really ruin the game, why use them at that point? Dice are only a randomizer; they are not the heart of the game. | . On the other side, you may feel like you are doing everything wrong and wondering why they keep coming back and having so much fun. This is pretty much how every good Imp feels at times, so relax. Tweaks and Hacks . Eldritch Gambit can bear house rules and options without groaning under the strain. Some examples: . | Exploding dice: if you want more unpredictable and deadly combat, consider using “exploding dice.” With this tweak, any time you Roll the max on a damage die, Roll it again and add the results. This can result in the occasional huge damage result and makes small damage dice more of a threat. This tweak can be polarizing; some players love it, but others outright hate it. | Static damage: Imps may want a relief from rolling damage for NPCs, especially during clashes. It is fine to use a static value of half the die max, plus any modifiers. If it starts to feel too predictable, switch it up with a die roll sometimes. You can do this for PCs as well. | Weapon degradation: rarely, a group will want to feel like their weapons could break or blunt with use. If they Roll a 1 for damage, the weapon downgrades to one die type lower (i.e., d8 to d6), to a minimum of d4. The Crafting Montage can repair all degradation, at the usual Difficulty for the weapon. | Setting perks: consider special features for characters to enjoy that come from just being in that setting. Birthday bonuses, astrological signs with real effects, modifiers for coming from different regions, blessings of the gods, etc. | Specific wounds: the Stagger penalty is a great general solution and is meant to reflect general shock and injury. You can spice things up with a specific set of injuries like head trauma, missing limbs, bleeding, etc. One way to do this could be a table to Roll on after Stagger. | . ",

    "content": "A Spell is a supernatural power made possible by permanent magical tools called Materia, expendable Ephemera , or from an inborn Trait. Regardless of method, anyone who can cast a Spell is a Caster. Range . A condition of willing imagination into reality is applying limits to the space it can affect. Every Spell has a Range in the usual Zones. Range:0 means it affects self or other in the same Zone, and Range:1 or more means it can reach that many Zones out. Casters can concentrate and double the Range on a Spell if it uses a Check. This lowers the Check to a d12 as usual, just like aiming a ranged weapon. Duration . Magic may be eternal, but time has meaning, and attention has limits. A spell either takes place all at once or requires focus to prolong. | Instant Spells end after casting. Consequences such as burning ships, healed wounds, etc. remain. | Lasting Spells end when dispelled, if the caster discards the magic item, if they choose a new target for that Spell, or just decide it is over. | . A caster can maintain any Lasting Spells they can currently cast, even all of them at once. If the caster wants to maintain a Lasting Spell on more than one target, they must have that many “copies” of it. Elements . Damage-inflicting Spells may have an Element as a prefix, such as Bolt, Cold, Fire, etc. For example, a Fire Blast could be a gout of flame, red hot lance, or a howling magma bat. An Elemental Spell is more effective against those vulnerable to the Element and less effective against those resistant to it. If there is no Elemental prefix for a damage-inflicting Spell, it does regular physical damage. COMMON ELEMENTS . | Element | Tag Effects | . | Bolt | Electricity, lightning, etc. | . | Cold | Freezing winds, ice attacks, etc. | . | Fire | Flames, hellfire, radiation, etc. | . | Void | Disintegration, micro-black holes, etc. | . Cantrips . Casters may use almost any Spell casually to achieve more minor effects, called Cantrips. For example, a Caster with a version of Blast[Fire] that could reduce a man to ashes could instead light a room with a flickering mote of flame or lay down a magical spiral sigil to heat a cooking pot. These can aid a narrative action, improve outcomes, and act as tools. They should not approach the effects of a more suitable Spell, however. Spell Descriptions . The following covers many Spells that may or may not be available in your setting. Their titles are intentionally broad, intended as a base for creating better-described magic in your games. You can and should rename and “reskin” these to suit the setting. LIST OF SPELLS . | Abjure: subtle mental defenses. WP-affecting Spell Checks targeting the caster must score a Critical to take effect. [Range 0, Lasting] Incoming Cha vs. WP Spells need a Critical to take effect. | Adhere: selectively sticky. After casting this Spell, climbing (Move), or Grapple Actions drop to half DF. Other Actions aided by adhesion may also benefit. [Range 0, Lasting] Half DF for climbing (Move) and Grapple Checks. | Attract: a powerful force holds in all who enter a Zone. This is an un-Checked Grapple Action with the Spell Rolling 1d8+Cha Grapple versus the Roll of everyone in that Zone. This Grapples any losers as usual, but the Caster suffers no effect if they lose. [Range 0, Instant] 1d8 +Cha Grapple Roll vs. all in Zone. | Burst: fires a lethal spread over an area. This automatically hits everyone in the Zone, friend or foe, for 1d8 +Cha damage. Elements can make this Spell more interesting. [Range 2, Instant] 1d8 +Cha damage to all in target Zone. | Barrier: calls up a wall or other obstacle. This provides Hard Cover and a DF 10 + Cha obstacle versus those trying to Move in or out of the zone it blocks. [Range 1, Lasting] Creates Hard Cover, obstacle DF is 10 +Cha. | Berserk: a strike that hungers for more blood. If this Melee Attack results in a Felling Blow, make another free Melee Attack on another foe in the same Zone. [Range 0, Instant] Free Melee Attack afterward if a Felling Blow. | Blast: fires off a powerful magical ranged attack, usually paired with an Element tag. This is a Ranged Attack for 1d12 +Cha damage. Reskinning can make this Spell more interesting. [Range 2, Instant] Ranged Attack, 1d12 +Cha damage. | Cache: Store items weightlessly in a weird space pocket and retrieve them at will. This stores up to 10 +Cha Load. Putting something in or taking it out is a Use Action, or a Grapple for the unwilling. If the Spell ends the contents spill out. [Range 0, Lasting] Store up to 10 +Cha Load. | Charm: A mesmerizing aura makes the caster very convincing to others. This halves the DF for mundane Cha-based Checks such as Parley and Perform. It is dangerous to overuse, as targets may come to realize they were under your influence later. [Range 1, Instant] Half DF for mundane Cha Checks. | Commune: telepathically links a group of willing minds who may “speak” to each other silently, at any distance, with no language barrier. This links up to ten plus the caster’s Cha minds until they or the Caster cut their connection. The Range of zero only applies when adding minds. [Range 0, Lasting] Telepathically link up to 10 +Cha minds. | Confuse: The caster’s banter and gestures bewilder the target. This is a Parley (Cha vs WP) inflicting the Confuse status if successful. [Range 1, Lasting] Parley Check to Confuse target. | Copy: soaks up the flavor of incoming magics. The caster can copy any Spell that targeted or affected them while active. The new Spell replaces the Copy Spell until ended. [Range 0, Lasting] Copy any Spell that affected the caster. | Cure: transmutes toxins. Roll 1d12 +Cha and reduce poison Buildup by that amount. If this drops Buildup below the target’s Base HP, any non-lethal (Incapacitated, etc.) Status inflicted by the poison ends. Also purifies food and drink. [Range 0, Instant] Reduce Buildup by 1d12 +Cha. | Deadeye: Guidance from beyond. If this Attack fails, a following gambit to avoid failure is vs. half the target’s actual AF. [Range 0, Instant] If the Attack Fails, half AF on Gambit to succeed. | Disguise: temporarily alters the target’s Description, i.e., facial features, skin color, weight, apparent age, sex, etc. This is a Craft (Cha vs. WP) Check, but only a Critical can disguise the unwilling. Dropping or dispelling reverts the target to their original form. [Range 0, Lasting] Craft Check (Cha vs. WP) to revise Description. | Edify: grants expertise in a specific field. Gain the benefits of a supplemental Class or Origin until the Spell ends. [Range 0, Lasting] Gain a Class or Origin until ended. | Empathy: gains insight from the minds of others. This halves the DF on Insight Checks vs. WP and allows the caster to detect a lie as an Outcome answer. [Range 2, Instant] Half DF on Insight Checks, may detect lies outright. | Enfeeble: causes weakness and uncertainty. This is a Parley Check, and success means the target must reroll a single die from any Rolls (damage, Rally, casting dice, etc.) and take the lowest result. [Range 1, Lasting] Parley Check, target Rerolls any Rolls and takes lowest. | Float: glide through the air with the greatest of ease. This easily overcomes most obstacles, falls, and ground hazards without a Move Check, and halves DF for the rest. Move actions may be in any direction, including up. Combining it with the Spring Spell mimics speedier flight. [Range 0, Lasting] Negate fall &amp; ground hazards, half DF on Moves vs. obstacles. | Grease: covers the ground with a slippery aura. This inflicts a 1d4 +Cha penalty to nearly any action taken within the target Zone. Can also be useful for oiling large mechanisms. [Range 1, Lasting] Zone turns slippery, inflicts 1d4 +Cha Penalty. | Haste: save up time from idle moments. This stores the Action it took to cast as a “free” other Action later. Once used, they may cast it again to store a new idle Action. Assume casters with this Spell have an Action stored unless they spent it that Scene. [Range 0, Lasting] Save an Action for later. | Hazard: creates a persistent dangerous area, such as a flaming rampart or a looming sphere of pure nothing. This inflicts 1d6 +Cha damage to all in or passing through the target Zone. If another Hazard is cast on the same area, it negates both. [Range 1, Lasting] All in Zone take 1d6 +Cha damage. | Heal: fixing delicate organisms with magic is far more difficult than blasting them to bits or turning them into frogs. Nevertheless, Healing magic allows impossible feats of medicine, halving the DF of Recovery Checks. [Range 0, Instant] Half DF for Recovery Checks. | Hold: move things from a distance. The caster can take regular Actions like Attack, Grapple, or Use from a Zone away, using Cha instead of Str. If grappling, the caster does not take damage back from the target’s Grapple Roll-off. [Range 1, Instant] Act at range using Cha as Str. | Imbue: create Materia and Ephemera. This allows the use of the caster’s crafting-related OCS to create magic items related to it. For example, a Blacksmith Class could create magic weapons, armor, or tools. This takes up resources and a Crafting Montage, as well as a Quest if the item is a Materia. [Range 0, Instant] Craft Ephemera and Materia. | Imperil: dulls the ability to react to danger. This is a Parley Check, success halves the target’s AF until ended. [Range 1, Lasting] Parley Check to halve target’s AF. | Insulate: a subtle but effective buffer against attacks with Element tags, such as Fire, Bolt, Void, etc. They are also comfortable in extreme weather even if not dressed for it. [Range 0, Lasting] half damage from Elements. | Morph: changes the target into the specified creature, such as turning a human into a frog or a chicken into a dragon. Each Template is a different Spell. This is a Check of Cha vs. WP, with Success applying the Template to a willing target and a Critical to an unwilling one. [Range 0, Lasting] Check Cha vs. WP to replace Template. | Phase: walk through solid objects and even people. This is a Move Action that automatically passes obstacles and walls but cannot end in a Zone filled with solid matter. It does not protect the caster from physical attacks. There are variants of this Spell that look more like a short teleport. [Range 0, Instant] Move action that passes obstacles and walls. | Pierce: bypasses or ignores armor. This is a Ranged Attack inflicting damage equal to the target’s Rally die +Cha. [Range 2, Instant] Ranged Attack for target’s Rally die +Cha dmg. | Protect: deflects peril in desperate situations. The caster takes half damage from a Felling blow, ending this Spell. Can be recast later for further protection. [Range 0, Lasting] Felling blow does half damage. | Purge mystical tricks to mend the damage to reality caused by other Spells. This grants a d20 to Dispel Checks even if the dispeller does not have the same Spell. [Range 1, Instant] Dispel Checks always use d20. | Repel: a wave of force pushes others away. This is an un-Checked Grapple (Push) Action inflicting 1d8 +Cha Grapple damage to all in the target Zone. Any “losers” who fail the Grapple Roll-off are pushed one Zone away from the target. Unlike a regular Grapple, the caster does not take damage in return if they lose the Roll-off. [Range 0, Instant] Resist 1d8+Cha Grapple Roll-off or shift one Zone away. | Scry: The caster may peer into a remote location. This allows an Insight Action about what is going on in an area of interest. This area can be of any distance away, but anyone within gets the eerie feeling of “being watched.” Those in the location with may target the caster with WP-affecting Spells. [Range 0, Instant] use Insight Action about target area. | Séance: the dead speak to you in their subtle way. When in a Zone with the remains of sentient beings, the caster makes an Insight Check on Cha vs. the mortal WP of the local dead (usually 11). The answers depend on what those who died in this area could know. [Range 0, Instant] Question the dead with a Cha Insight Check. | Seeker: fires a guided magical bolt, usually paired with an Element tag. This is a Ranged Attack inflicting 1d8 +Cha damage. If the caster misses and wants to use a Gambit, halve the target’s AF for the Gambit. [Range 2, Instant] Ranged Attack for 1d8 + Cha dmg, if a miss, half AF on Gambit. | Shell: Surrounds the caster with a force field. The caster or target gains Armor (AP) equal to 10 plus their Cha. This does not stack with worn armor or increase the Rally die. [Range 0, Lasting] Armor AP equal to 10 +Cha. | Smite: a surge of incredible might. This Action imbues the target’s next Str Roll with an extra die of the same type. After the Roll, this Spell ends. [Range 0, Lasting] Add a die to an upcoming Str Roll. | Spring: leap into the air like a moon jump. This lets the caster or target Move up to two Zones in any direction, halving fall damage and DF for most obstacles. It is not flight unless combined with Float, as they must land at the end of the Round. [0, Instant] Move two Zones in any direction, halve fall damage and DF for obstacles. | Summon: creates an obedient semi-real servant of the caster’s own design. Create an NPC with a total Threat (Base + Load) equal to ¼ the caster’s Level, rounded up as usual. Their Template must have the Unstable Trait (-2 Load) and cannot have Summon Spells of their own. A summon disappears when fallen or dispelled but can be resummoned. Design this creature outside of game time as not to interrupt play. [Range 0, Lasting] Calls up creature with a total Threat (Base + Load) of ¼ caster Level. | Sustain: fuels the needs of the body. Those under this Spell do not suffer from thirst, hunger, fatigue, or suffocation. This Spell does not fix existing Deprivation effects. It just keeps them from accumulating. [Range 0, Lasting] Cannot gain new Deprivation effects. | Teleport: snaps the caster back to a preset location. This is cast while in the target Zone. At the beginning of any of their later Actions, the caster may instantly return to it with anything they are carrying. [Range 0, Lasting] Sets a Zone that can be returned to instantly later. | Vanish: An illusion makes the target invisible. This is a Sneak Action at half the usual DF that also grants Soft Cover (-4). Other Actions do not gain this benefit. [Range 0, Instant] Soft Cover (-4 to hit), Sneak Check at half DF. | Vorpal: a devastating and savage attack that seeks out the weak points of a foe. If it succeeds, the following Gambit for a Critical Success is vs half AF. [Range 0, Instant] If the Attack succeeds, half AF on the Gambit to Critical. | Zombify: raise a nearby corpse as an undead servant. They arise as a Zombie with a Threat Base equal to the Caster’s level divided by four, rounded up as usual. Zombies keep their original gear and Traits but lose their Concepts. They gain the Undead (0 Load) and Unstable (-2 Load) Traits. A Fallen or dispelled zombie cannot be reanimated. [Range 0, Lasting] Raises undead servant with Threat Base of ¼ caster Level. | . DIY Spells . If reskinning an existing Spell does not cut it, you can make one from scratch using the existing ones as guidance. A popular method is to give those using the Spell half DF at something specific and add a little extra something for fun. If especially powerful, you may want to limit its use or give it interesting drawbacks. If it is integral to the setting it may work better as an Artifact.

    "title": "Materia",
    "content": "A Materia is an item permanently imbued with magical power. These grant their wielder one or more Spells to cast at will. For example, a sword that can burst into flame, a flying broom, a wolf tattoo that springs to life, etc. Casters must spend a single WP to attune their minds with a Materia before they can cast its Spells. This WP does not come back until they discard the item or someone else spends a WP to wield it. Most are found, stolen, or granted. Few are made or bought. Prices vary wildly in the rare places they are offered, and the risk to the seller is astronomical. The Insight Check to reveal the Spells in an a found Materia is usually vs. DF 10. Using WP also reveals the Spells but is less useful when divvying up loot. Crafting Materia . To create a Materia, a character with the Imbue Spell must create a Superior version of that item (Critical). They must also incorporate a symbolic item that reflects the intended Spell(s). For example, a Roc feather for a flying carpet or the last breath of a king for a crown of necromancy. This component must be dearly bought with a worthy Quest. Symbolic components gained too easily lack the metaphysical gravitas to fuel Materia. Poetry aside, the DF for this Crafting Check is the same as creating an item of its type, i.e., five plus the maximum on the damage or Rally die. This results in an item that grants one Spell. An item can be imbued with more than one Spell buy adding the max die again for each. Miscellaneous non-combat items like wands or capes typically count as 1d4, making them prime targets for enchantment. MATERIA CRAFTING DF . | Rally or Damage | 1 Spell | 2 Spells | 3 Spells | 4 Spells | . | d4 | 9 | 13 | 17 | 21 | . | d6 | 11 | 17 | 23 | 29 | . | d8 | 13 | 21 | 29 | 37 | . | d10 | 15 | 25 | 35 | 45 | . | d12 | 17 | 29 | 41 | 53 | . A Materia may be reforged into a different item type at the same difficulty, without a new Quest. EXAMPLE MATERIA . | Codswallop: A flail shaped like a fish. The scales can move on their own for a devastating chainsaw effect. Reaching into its mouth reveals an extradimensional hiding place for all manner of goods. Spells: Cache, Smite. | Dormant Demon: partial possession by an indolent entity blocks other mental intrusions. Just hope it doesn’t wake up. Spell: Abjure. | Ember of the First Flame: A still-burning coal stolen from the first fire of the gods, before it was made harmful to man. When laid on the chest of the ill or maimed, its primordial warmth suffuses them with life. Spell: Heal. | Flying Carpet: a small fine carpet that unrolls and floats on command. If passengers also ride, their Load applies to the owner as if they were being carried. Spells: Float, Spring. | Halo Cutter: this glowing golden halo hovers over the bearer’s head, shedding light as a lamp. More importantly, it protects their soul from outside influences and can swoop out to dismember those who offend. Spells: Abjure, Seeker. | Hand of Glory: This Candelabra made from a hideous waxy dead hand is the envy of every thief or ambitious intruder. Pressing it against an obstacle allows the wielder to pass through to the other side like a ghost. Spell: Phase. | Necropants: an ugly pair of pants made from human skin. Grants incredible speed and has unnaturally deep pockets. Spells: Spring, Cache. | Thighbone Flute: this macabre musical instrument has three special tunes. One disorients listeners, one blasts them away from the wielder with a wall of sound, and one controls an undead servant. Spells: Confuse, Zombify, Repel. | . ",

    "title": "Ephemera",
    "content": "Small expendable items imbued with power. They enable any sentient being to cast a single Spell one or more times but break when it ends. For example, drinking a potion, using a scroll, firing an arrow, etc. The Spell uses the wielder’s Attributes, and otherwise counts as originating from them. Ephemera tend to be small compact items of negligible weight, priced at about 100 cp each. Scrolls and potions are popular, but many creators punch things up by crafting them out of more thematic ingredients. Selling them nets half price at best. The Insight Check to reveal the Spell in a found Ephemera is usually vs. DF 5, DF10 if exotic or unfamiliar. Many will have their use written on the label. Unlike Materia, Ephemera inflict little strain on the mind and do not lower WP. Unfortunately, they do not hold out for as long either. Those with Lasting durations end when a new Montage begins. Crafting Ephemera . To create or add a charge to an Ephemera, one needs the ability to cast the Imbue Spell and the desired Spell. This is a Crafting Check, usually Wis vs. the local Travel DF. Criticals yield an extra Ephemera. Creating an Ephemera eats up about 50 cp each time due to materials. EXAMPLE EPHEMERA . | Black Meat: a dried strip of dark oily flesh from some awful interdimensional centipede. Its taste is repugnant but fascinating, heightening senses exponentially as the mind tries to correlate the contents of the mouth. Spell: Alarm. | Blade Pitch: the contents of this sulfurous sachet alight when rubbed across a weapon, turning it into a brand of fire. Spells: Smite [Fire]. | Blessed Larva: an enchanted cocoon in a small woven basket. If it successfully Purges the magic, it hatches and flies away as a full-grown moth. If it fails, it crumbles into ash. Spell: Purge. | Crimson Cap: this vivid red mushroom sends the eater into a fighting trance. Spell: Berserk. | Horse Chestnut: hurl this to the ground and a vegetal horse arises. Good for a quick escape but obstinately plants itself into the ground when its time runs out. Spell: Summon [Riding Horse]. | Mordant Herb: this bitter leaf counteracts poison and disease when properly enchanted. Spell: Cure. | Portal Chalk: a bit of chalk. The caster draws a door, setting that place as the destination. Later, they can draw another and step back through the original destination door. Spell: Teleport. | Pyrocart: a chunky copper cartridge that loads into a flame Staff. Spell: Blast. | Star-squid egg cluster: this cluster of hard nacreous globules hardly registers as a living thing, but when hurled down forcefully it erupts into a maelstrom of flailing tentacles. It is rumored that new dormant clusters appear in the wreckage years later. Spell: Hazard. | That’s It in a Nutshell: the final word of a dying mystic, revealing the secret to life, the universe, and everything. When cracked open, thunder and trumpets peal from beyond, drowning out the words of enlightenment and hurling bystanders out of reach. Spell: Repel. | Thorn of Agony: this clove-like thorn brings renewed vigor when driven into the flesh of an injured ally. This is unspeakably painful and does no favors for their friendship.

    "content": "These are fundamental magical flaws, laws, glitches, or events in the game setting, far beyond the mischief of a Spell. Their effects can be absolute and unfair, such as a youth-granting fountain, a perilous cubic void, random distortions in time, etc. Others may even seem trivial or random, such as cooking the perfect boiled egg. Artifacts are so diverse they are best left to narration; some affect the workings of entire planets. They can break characters, games, or worlds. They are supposed to. There is usually only one such Artifact in the setting, and the owner may attract a great deal of attention just for having it. Most are more trouble than they are worth. Those that are sentient and don’t get along with their bearer may withhold power to chastise them. Some have unpalatable motives of their own, such as world destruction, ranch dressing, utter conformity, etc. Those taking the great risk of selling an Artifact can name their price. The Insight Check to reveal what an unfamiliar found Artifacts does is usually vs. DF 15. Those that can communicate are usually more than eager to reveal it that way. An Artifact may also be a Materia, but this is just begging for trouble. EXAMPLE ARTIFACTS . | Gold Verbena: this auric herb pops up every spring in a random patch of dirt. The eater transforms into any creature they desire and stays that way until it is eaten by a new finder next spring. This works like the Morph Spell but cannot be dispelled or dropped. Powerful figures seek this herb out in a bloody yearly contest. | Infinity Lance: this long black pole extends into infinity when a button on its handle is pressed, piercing all in its way for 1d6x10 damage before snapping back to its original length. Occupied planets and interstellar beings are few and far between, so the chances of accidentally impaling one and provoking a war are… probably slim? | Shakedown Monument: this is life-sized statue of one man holding another upside down, with coins falling out of his pockets. When touched, it takes the item your character wants most (be honest) from someone else and teleports it right to them. If the original owner tries to use the statue to get it back, it disappears forever. | Tiny Banjo: when given to a mouse, it grabs the banjo and does a pitch perfect impression of Paul Newman singing “Plastic Jesus” from the movie Cool Hand Luke. It then goes back to being a normal mouse, if better for the experience. As useless as this sounds, up-and-coming bards will do about anything to hear the alien melody which has infected the musical landscape. | . ",

    "content": "The easiest thing to do in a game setting is to just base the money on whatever is familiar to your players. In American games, you might use “copper pieces” or “cp” as a base and just say 1 cp is about a dollar. Unless your group is fond of numismatics, this makes dealing with money easier. That said, a detailed currency can really bring a setting to life. Random pockets or treasures may consist of coins with different origins, weights, metals, and sizes. Silver and gold are popular for high-value coins. The price lists shown below are mostly to aid character creation. Do not feel constrained by these. The real price for anything is whatever the seller thinks they can get away with charging. Treasures . Individual treasures (gems, jewelry, etc.) have a listed value. This is what the seller gets for them if they do not sweat the details. Those who choose to Parley may get more or less. If a Treasure is “hot” or stolen from someone with social standing, the party may have to deal with a fence to sell it. Fences buy for about half the listed value on a good day, but characters can always Parley to improve things. Other Resources . Aside from coin, there is power in more abstract resources: debts, promises, emotional baggage, titles of nobility, enemies, hauntings, alignment to regional factions, family bonds, friendships, your reputation, tendencies, etc. All are meaningful. These have just as much right to space in the Resources box of your character sheet as a 10’ pole and change of underwear. These come and go, and their “worth” depends on how you use them. ",

Special is any distinctive features the weapon might have, as described in the legend below the table), and Load is the encumbrance of the weapon. Str adds to damage for every listed weapon. This is true even for bows and crossbows, as these must be set for a particular Str. Anyone weaker cannot draw or load the bow or crossbow. Futuristic or weird fantasy weapons like guns, lenses, or blasters may break this rule with set damage or different Attributes for the damage bonus. Ranged weapons have a Range, shown as the number of Zones their Attacks can reach. You can fire from up to twice as far by dropping the Attack Check to a d12. One may throw a melee weapon at a target in the same Zone even if it has no listed range. The advantage is this prevents clashes on a failure, but the disadvantage is they are no longer wielding it. Superior weapons raise to hit and damage by one but are ten times the price. Inferior weapons are half price but lower to hit and damage by one. Shields . A shield deflects damage, conceals weak spots, and absorbs impact. This grants a bonus to AF against all physical attacks targeting the wielder. STANDARD SHIELDS . | Shield type | Example | AF | Block | Load | cp | . | Small | Buckler | +1 | +3 | 0 | 60 | . | Medium | Target | +2 | +2 | 1 | 80 | . | Large | Heater | +3 | +1 | 2 | 120 | . A shield is also a weapon, bashing for 1d6+Str damage regardless of size. Shields and other Blocking weapons aid Melee clashes/failures: add the Block bonus to the wielder’s Clash damage Roll. Ammunition . Ammo is a balancing factor for ranged weapons, so Players should keep track of their own arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc. They may be opportunities to scrounge for missed or dropped ammo, and most Imps should be lenient there. Standard Weapons . The table below gives only a sample of common fantasy weapons. If you have something in mind that is not on this list, improvise using the values in the table as a reference. All prices listed are for good fighting quality weapons and assume merchants are ripping eager adventurers off just a bit.

Entangle: binds a foe, forcing them to make a Grapple Roll vs. the original damage each Round or lose Action. Grapple: May use its damage Roll instead of unarmed damage when Grappling. Range: Can attack a target from this distance in Zones, or twice that with a d12. You may throw weapons with no listed range in the same Zone with a d12. Reach: No excess damage in return if they lose a clash/melee failure. Can still be countered on a Botch. Reload: Use (reload) Actions needed to ready the weapon before firing again. Stun: does full rolled damage when striking to Subdue. Wrap: ignore the target’s Shield bonus to AF. ",

    "title": "Staging",
    "content": "A scene is just imaginary time and space in which things happen. Staging is the background parts that help Scenes work, resolving time, space, and spotlight with a few simple rules. Time . Fussing over exact measures of time within an imaginary world rarely leads to memorable stories at the gaming table. Instead, Eldritch Gambit uses just two types of Scenes to do this: Action and Montage. | Action Scenes are for fast-paced dramatic Actions like fighting, sneaking, and persuasion. These usually take only seconds or minutes. Action Scenes can be further divided into roughly six-second Rounds when Initiative is declared. | Montage Scenes are for long Montages taking hours to weeks. Any task that would eat up most of a day is probably a Montage. These include events like travel, healing, training, and shopping. Montages take a long time for the characters, but to the players they are mercifully brief. | . Other measures of time can include Session; meaning the entire game that day, or Campaign; meaning a series of Sessions fitting a theme. Distance . Eldritch Gambit measures distance in loosely defined imaginary spaces called Zones. These are based on obstacles and areas of interest more than strict space: a small closet can be a Zone, as can a coliseum. Larger areas are often split into several Zones to keep things sensible. Zones are things unto themselves and can have interesting features, such as Cover, obstacles , etc. This method works well with both theatre of the mind and table maps. Defining an area in Zones encourages clever tactics and engaging narration of their features. If you are using a dry-erase map (and minis!) you can even trace out the Zones in color. Because Zones vary in size, effective range and movement also vary depending on how many Zones an area is split into! If this seems baffling, consider that small, cluttered areas are also hard to aim around or move through. The effective range of a move or weapon is not going to be as far as on a large Zone like a flat plain. Initiative . This decides who-goes-when in Action Scenes where the order matters, usually combat. Eldritch Gambit uses a modified version of Elective Initiative called “Volleyball” Initiative. The one proposing the first hostile Action both holds and triggers Initiative. If there is an argument, let the Imp decide or just check who has the highest current WP. The one holding Initiative gets to take the first Action. If their target has an Action, that target must go next. If more than one target, they may choose from the survivors. If not, the holder hands it to anyone else with an Action. If they choose a foe, they can specify or let the Imp decide which one. Initiative splits an Action Scene into Rounds. When everyone has spent their Action, a new Round begins. Everyone gets their Action back, and the last holder can now pass Initiative normally. They may even pass to themselves if they did not target anyone. One may Wait by selecting a specific Action, such as “ranged Attack” and holding off until the right moment. They may take that Action any time later, even if it interrupts someone else’s. They cannot change the type of Action. If no opportunity arises, they decide at the start of the next Round to keep waiting or rejoin the regular Initiative scheme. Initiative ends when the conflict is over, by whatever means. Refill HP back to maximum unless the character is Fallen or otherwise cannot Rally. INITIATIVE . The Anycheck . Imps can handle just about any action by making a decision or calling a “fiat” Check on the spot. The Actions and Montages below are only specific cases, or “successful recipes” derived from the Basics given earlier in this book. They are not demands about how you must play the game. You can view the Anycheck template as a sort of “universal” Action or Montage. This should make it easier to deal with unexpected tasks without having to comb through this chapter each time. It also helps when designing your own Actions or Montages. The first part of each Action or Montage just tells what it is and when you might use it. The Check or Roll tells you what Attributes and/or Defenses are usually involved. The OCS line tells what sort of Classes, Origins, or Skills (OCS) grant a d20. Next comes a list of suggested outcomes: . Roll/Check: Roll or Check, suggested stats. OCS: Relevant Class, Origin, or Skill examples. | Critical: Success with an extra benefit! | Success: You overcame the situation. | Failure: The situation overcame you. | Botch: Failure with an extra drawback! | . You can enrich your own settings by making special Actions or Montages to fit them. Before doing this though, ask yourself three things: First, does an existing Action or Montage already cover it? Second, does the outcome truly need a random element? And third, would success or failure be interesting enough to drive the game forward? . Defaults . All Checks below include suggested defaults for Criticals and Botches. As described above in the Basics section, they are there for two reasons. The first is to make choice a choice – if you want to move on, just use the default! They are perfectly suitable for most situations. The second is to give an out for the Player or Imp if haggling over a Critical or Botch becomes contentious. Once either party choose the default, you can end the discussion. To be clear; you are not stuck with the defaults in the Outcomes tables. You may choose others if they look fun and make sense. ",

    "title": "Actions",
    "content": "Most games spend the bulk of their time in fast-paced Action Scenes. These support combat, persuasion, magic, stealth, intrigue, chases, athletics, etc. While it is fun to role-play these to the hilt, it is not crucial that a player be good at these personally. You do not need to be a trained fencer in real life to Attack, nor a suave diplomat to use Parley. It is enough for the player to describe what the character is doing and let their abilities fill in the rest. The combat-focused Actions (Attack, Grapple) all Check with a d20, at least for adventurers. Other Actions Check on a d12 unless the character has the right Origin, Class, or Skill (OCS) to support it. When Initiative comes into play, an Action Scene splits into Rounds. Each Round, combatants get an Action as well as an extra Move Action . This Free Move must be used before their regular Action or it is wasted. If the Action is lost for any reason, so is the Free Move. Free Moves are never Checked and thus cannot be used to pass obstacles. Attack, Melee . Do violence to a foe from within the same Zone, such as swinging a sword, throwing a punch, flailing wildly, etc. Melee attackers must choose Gambits wisely, weighing the chance for a decisive strike against that of a humiliating counter. The Player may describe an attack as one blow or many. If successful, Roll the damage dice for the weapon and add any mods, then subtract this from the target’s HP. Check: Dex vs. AF. OCS: All adventurers use d20 for Attacks. | Critical: hit and add Bonus damage equal to the max of your usual damage die. | Success: hit &amp; Roll damage + mods. | Failure: clash, both sides Roll damage + mods, winner inflicts excess on the loser. | Botch: Countered: miss &amp; take hit from foe! | . On a Critical, the extra damage is equal to the highest possible result on their largest damage die. For example, a fist-fighter with +2 Str (1d4+2 dmg) would do 1d4+6 on a Critical. A Botch is a counter: inflict the foe’s best melee damage on the attacker. A Failure or “clash of arms” starts a Roll-off using the best damage dice for their wielded weapons. For example, two fist-fighters Roll 1 and 3 as damage. The one with 3 wins and does 2 damage (3-1) to the loser. | Area Attacks blast everyone in a Zone with no Check. | Disarm Attacks twist or slap a weapon out of grasp. This is a sort of physical “deal” - If the target drops it, they avoid the damage | Provoke Attacks draw a foe’s attention. Like disarms, if a foe agrees to target them with their next Action (if possible), that foe avoids damage. | Split Attacks divide the Action into two attacks, each using a d12 instead of a d20. These can use the same or different weapons. One cannot make a Split Attack while Staggered. | Subdual Attacks knock a foe out. Non-stun weapons do half damage, but on a Felling blow, the target is Incapacitated instead of taking damage. | . Area and Split attacks may leave multiple choices for passing initiative. If more than one target survives with an Action, the attacker chooses among them. Wielding multiple melee weapons offers no benefit aside from a wider array of attack types. Attack, Ranged . Do violence upon a foe from afar; fire a bow or crossbow, throw a pebble (quite thrilling!), cast an aimed Spell, etc. Ranged attackers weigh the chance of a kill shot against missing, or worse – accidentally shooting a nearby ally. If successful, Roll the damage dice for the weapon and add any mods, then subtract this from the target’s HP. Check: Dex vs. AF. OCS: All adventurers use d20 for Attack. | Critical: hit and add Bonus damage equal to the max of your usual damage die. | Success: hit &amp; Roll damage + mods. | Failure: foe evades your shot. | Botch: Friendly fire: target chooses another to take the damage! If none, just a regular miss. | . Eligible targets for a Botch are those in the same Zone or line of fire. It’s easier to aim with no allies in the way, making it safe to Gambit on a Failure. You can double a weapon’s range in Zones by downgrading the Check to a d12 instead of a d20. For example, a range 2 weapon can reach up to 4 Zones in this manner. You cannot do this if Staggered. You can throw a non-ranged melee weapon and treat that as a Ranged Attack. This avoids clashes and counters, but such an errant throw can only be made within the same Zone. As with Melee, Ranged Attacks can also be Area, Disarm, Provoke, Split, or Subdual, depending on the weapon. Split attacks can only be made with two different weapons or one that does not need a Load (Use) Action every firing. Otherwise, wielding multiple ranged weapons offers no benefit aside from a wider choice of attacks. Dispel . Casters need not endure the magic of others. This Action forcibly ends another caster’s Spell. Dispel is a Check of Wis vs. their WP with a Range of 1. This Check uses a d12 if the caster has access to any Spell, and a d20 if they can cast any of the Spells affecting the target. An Ephemera can Dispel but this uses up a Charge. Dispel can also unweave the magic that animates creatures with the Unstable Trait, such as undead and summons. Check: Wis vs. WP OCS: None, d12 if caster has any Spell, d20 if same Spell. | Critical: Choose Spells to dispel. | Success: Ends all Spells on or from target. | Failure: Spell persists. | Botch: Countered, persists &amp; dispeller Confused. | . The Confusion on a Botch ends next Scene. A Botch can also cause a harmful Spell to spread to the dispeller as well, like an infection. If there is more than one Spell on the target, Dispel rids reality of them all. Treat these effects as ended and apply the consequences. On a Critical, the dispeller can pick and choose. Dispelling an Instant Spell requires the Wait option during Initiative. A Dispel is also effective in the gap between an Overcharge and the actual casting of an Instant Spell. Dodge . A last-ditch defense that goes beyond relying on passive AF. Dodges can be made immediately after being Attacked, even interrupting a Split Attack to do so. Check AGI versus the result of the foe’s original Attack Check. If successful, the attack misses. If it fails, the attack resolves as it normally would. Check: AGI vs. Attack result. OCS: All adventurers use d20 for Dodge. | Critical: avoid attack &amp; choose to inflict the Countered or Friendly fire Botches on foe. | Success: you evade your foe’s attack. | Failure: your foe’s attack lands. | Botch: Stumble, lose next Action getting up. | . This defensive Action is unusual because you can choose to Dodge even a failed melee Attack. This lets one avoid a clash-of-arms Roll-off, which is great if they are likely to lose such a vulgar contest of might. A Critical lets one Counter or apply the incoming damage as Friendly fire to another eligible target. An “Eligible” target means in the same Zone or line of fire. These work the same as the default Botches for ranged or melee Attacks, above. If these don’t apply, don’t go for a Critical or think up another way it could benefit the dodger. Grapple . This restrains or controls a foe with a grab, hold, pin, or throw. Grapple is a Check of Dex vs. AF. If it hits, both sides Roll-off unarmed damage against each other. The one who rolls highest is the “winner,” inflicting any excess damage and the Grappled status on the “loser.” This means the loser loses their Action until they escape. Check: Dex vs. AF. OCS: All adventurers use d20 for Grapple. | Critical: hit as below &amp; add bonus grapple damage equal to the max of your usual die! | Success: both Roll-off unarmed damage + Str; winner inflicts excess &amp; Grappled status. | Failure: an impasse, neither side Rolls. | Botch: Countered, miss and take hit from foe! | . Both sides make a new Roll-off each Round to keep the hold unless the loser Submits. Submitting just avoids further hurtful Roll-offs in exchange for not resisting. Neither side needs to Check again, only Roll. If the loser wins the Roll-off later, they may escape instead of reversing the hold. As the loser has no Action, the current winner passes Initiative to anyone else with an Action. You can choose other effects below instead of inflicting the Grappled Status. The loser keeps their Action in these cases, only losing their Free Move. Seize: The winner grabs an item or weapon out of the loser’s grasp and into theirs. This is similar to Disarm but the winner now wields the item. Push/Pull/Carry: The winner moves the target up to a Zone away and may come along. This can move the loser into or away from obstacles. Grappling requires a free hand, but weapons do not interfere much. Some weapons even have the Grapple property, such as man-catchers and whips. These use their damage for the Grapple Roll. Guard . This protects a more precious ally within the same Zone. The guarding character simply steps in as the target of an Attack made on someone else. This interrupts normal Initiative. An Attacker can get past a Guard with a Critical, but this only does regular damage (no Bonus damage) to the original target. Insight . Remember, investigate, interrogate, pontificate. This uses the character’s knowledge to reveal helpful facts. For example, a sorcerer remembering what an Ephemera does, a scholar translating runes inscribed over a door, a woodsman following tracks, a tailor guessing how long petrified noble’s outfit has been out of style, a gambler figuring out a tell, a delver examining a trap etc. It is up to the Player to explain why their OCS grants them relevant info. If the info is for specific knowledge, this uses Wis vs. a DF based on how rare the knowledge is. Insight about a target’s state of mind is Wis vs. WP instead. Success means the character knows the answer. The Player should frame these questions carefully and Imps should be generous! There is no real drawback to giving out info to help move the game along. Check: Wis vs. WP or variable DF (usually 10). OCS: Investigation, tracking, crafting, etc. | Critical: Imp answers two relevant questions! | Success: Imp answers one relevant question. | Failure: only info they should know outright. | Botch: one right and one wrong answer! | . On a Botch, the Imp should make it hard to tell which answer is right. Of course, they can also grant two right answers just to inflict doubt! . This game does not use Checks to “find” or “notice” things. Instead, you use this to understand what you are seeing. Likewise, Insight never tells you if an NPC is lying outright. Rather, it presents an opportunity to reveal suspicious or inconsistent parts of their story. Just having the right OCS entitles one to a lot even without a Check. For example, a woodsman easily finds tracks but may need a Check to guess what they are carrying or where they are going. Move . Running, climbing, fleeing, jumping, swimming, scaling massive foes, evading traps, etc. This moves the character into an adjacent Zone. It is rarely Checked unless there is an obstacle or trap. Faster creatures may move more Zones in a Move, while slow ones take more Moves to cross a Zone. This Action is special because everyone gets a Free Move before their Action. Using the Free Move then a Move Action is “running,” and crosses two Zones. A Free Move is never Checked and cannot pass an obstacle or trap – if they try, it becomes their regular Move Action. This slows those who did not take the quick and easy path. Check: none, or Agi vs. DF of the obstacle. OCS: athletic or travel related. | Critical: overcome, plus Aid ally or Hinder foe. | Success: overcome obstacle or trap | Failure: halted by obstacle or trap | Botch: Stumble: lose next Action! | . Three things that may call for a Check are chases, obstacles, scaling larger foes, and traps: . | Chases involve quarry and pursuers using Move Actions through a set of chase Zones, with the quarry deciding where to go. Obstacles often determine who wins. | Obstacles like walls, rivers, brambles, etc. hinder moves into that Zone. For example, a wall must be scaled or breached to enter. | Scaling larger foes that count as their own Zone or more to climb upon and deal with riders, etc. The DF for this is the larger creature’s AF. | Traps harm those who fail to Move past. | . Overcast . An Overcast charges up certain Spells for a more devastating effect. A Caster may spend their Action to add a die to an upcoming Spell with a Rolled effect or damage die. The overcast Spell must be the very next Action. For example, a caster using a Seeker Spell that does 1d8 +Cha damage would Overcast their Spell as one Action, then cast it for 2d8 +Cha on their next. All other Spell features remain the same. If a Spell does not have a Rolled effect, it does not benefit from an Overcast. Parley . Haggling, seduction, diplomacy, lies, threats, bribery, negotiation, persuasion, etc. are valid alternatives or preludes to battle. Most conversations need not call upon dice, but this can divine one if an NPC reaction is uncertain. Parley can make a charismatic “face” party member even more useful. Keep in mind that this is not mind-control; it only shifts the tone. Parley is a Check of Cha vs. WP. Leverage for or against may grant a bonus or penalty. In a diplomatic Scene, the sides may each get turns to influence each other with different arguments or offers. Check: Cha vs. WP. OCS: con-artist, merchant, politics, romance, etc. | Critical: best possible reaction! | Success: they react better to what you say. | Failure: their reaction fits the situation as-is. | Botch: their reaction to you worsens! | . The Parley Check shifts the narrative for better or worse, but the possible outcomes still depend on context. Targets also stay true to their nature even on an extreme result. For example, a success when flattering the king may yield a gift, while a success when insulting the king may only stun them long enough to flee. A valid threat may still intimidate on a Botch, but they may misinterpret what you want them to do. Players on the losing side of a Parley are still in charge of their characters and can even reject the outcome. They can also be good sports instead; going along with it and proposing different outcomes. This is also a good excuse for an XP Highlight. Perform . Impress, sway, or draw a crowd with singing, comedy, oration, dancing, instruments, etc. Perform is a Check of Cha vs. the highest WP in a crowd. Performers may get a bonus if they know what a crowd wants to see or hear. This also makes a great distraction so other party members can do more nefarious things. Check: Cha vs. WP (or highest WP of audience). OCS: oratory, musical, dance, comedy, etc. | Critical: a rousing performance, achieve fame in the area! | Success: a pleased and interested crowd gathers. | Failure: little interest or attention. | Botch: the crowd becomes hostile or leaves! | . Performers in a diverse group or band may use Teamwork, condensing their efforts into a single Strongest-link Check of the highest Attribute and most relevant Skill. If missing a part (drummer, clown, etc.) they may incur a penalty. Rally . A pause to steel your nerves and catch your breath during combat. This restores 1d4 + End HP, up to the character’s maximum. One can only Rally if chosen to receive Initiative by another. They are too distracted to Rally if a friend or foe targeted them with an Action before passing on the Initiative. It’s hard to Rally alone - or with allies who do not have your back! . An upside to this is that instead of their own End, the rallier may use the Cha of the ally that passed Initiative to them. Play this out with a few words of encouragement. Heavier armor grants a larger Rally die. It is good strategy to take cover, feign death, or retreat at low HP so you can Rally. You can then re-enter the fray in fighting trim. Roll: recover 1d4* + End HP. *unarmored - armor improves this die. When the conflict fades and Initiative ends, HP returns to maximum without a Rally. One cannot Rally while taking ongoing damage, such as from the Burning Status. Sneak . Moving silently and hiding in shadows is a terrific way to evade foes and get into places you are not supposed to be. This only allows you to remain unnoticed by others. It is not possible if someone is looking right at you, or if you have nowhere to hide. Sneak is a Skilled Check of Agi vs. the foe’s WP, or the highest in a group. Check: Agi vs. WP. OCS: criminal, acrobatic, wilderness, etc. | Critical: sneak past even alert foes! | Success: sneak past most foes. | Failure: sneak past sleeping or distracted foes. | Botch: everyone notices you! | . The outcomes of Sneak depend on how alert the foe was in the first place. An Alert foe has reason to suspect someone is trying to sneak past or hide from them. Most foes, even guards, do not fall into this category unless something has gone awry already. A foe may be Distracted by something, such as a tossed pebble, ongoing card game, minstrel show, etc. Cover is necessary for Sneak, whether from darkness, a crowd, or obstacles. Penalties for darkness or visibility also affect the sneaker, however, causing them to stumble around noisily in the dark. Distractions, such as allies using Perform or Parley, can also count as cover. The start of an encounter often presents the opportunity to Sneak up on or around foes. If this works the party can avoid them, eavesdrop, or launch a Surprise Attack. The latter inflicts the Surprised Status: foes lose their Action that round and halve their AF. This lasts until next Round. Imps should only call for a single Sneak Check once during Action or Montage to remain unnoticed. More than this skews unfairly toward discovery. Insight Checks do not reveal hidden characters but may grant clues leading to their discovery. Sneak can also pickpocket, steal or plant small items by switching to Dex and a relevant OCS. This should be limited to items of about 1 Load whose weight will not be obvious in its relief. Use . This covers miscellaneous moves using a tool or item. Some tasks can take several Use Actions. For example, pulling something from a sack or bag is one Use Action, while using the item pulled from it afterward is another. Like Move, most casual Use Actions like pulling a lever, reloading a weapon, or drinking a potion do not require a Check. For complex, risky moves like picking locks, using a grappling hook, or disarming traps, the Outcomes are as follows: . Check: usually Wis vs. situational DF. OCS: any crafting, thievery, artistic, etc. | Critical: Finished the task very quickly! | Success: Did what the tool or item does | Failure: Did not finish the task | Botch: Cannot finish task, broke tools, etc.! | . As the name implies, you usually need the proper tools to even start. Sometimes you can jury-rig tools out of whatever is nearby, such as making lockpicks out of a hairpin, etc. These typically allow a Check but at a -2 penalty or worse. If the DF is well within the range of the character’s ability with no pressing consequence for failure, using things is best left to narration. ",

    "doc": "Scenes",
    "title": "Montages",
    "content": "Transitions between more climactic events, Montages are lengthy periods in the story condensed into brief moments of play. Long journeys, smithing projects, healing, etc. are all handled this way. To do this, the Imp allows each player one Montage then moves along to the next player or Scene. This helps with pacing and avoids entire sessions of agonizing over minutia. Sometimes players pursue Montages on vastly different time scales. For example, one PC may go on a week-long journey back to town while the others fix up some broken gear. It may be fair to give an extra Montage to those working on shorter projects. During a Montage Scene, the rest of the world may advance their plans and agendas as well. Some Imps may keep track of how many Montage Scenes can take place before an event occurs, good or bad. Like Actions, it is fine to have Montages succeed without Checks. This is often the case for travel to a familiar area and other things that do not need to be played out. As usual, if one does not have the right Class, Origin, or Skill (OCS) for the Montage, the Check uses d12. If they do, it uses d20. Crafting . If players want to make or repair something, they must have the right tools and materials. They then Check Wis with a relevant crafting OCS. Crafting Checks should only be called for if there is time pressure or real doubt about making the item. For example, the first time making it or when going for a Critical. DCs for crafting vary: . | Weapons: DF is 5 + the max on the Damage die. | Armor: DF is 5 + the max on the Rally die. | Other/Ephemera: local Travel DF or higher. | . Check: Wis vs. situational DF. OCS: any crafting career, writing, painting, etc. | Critical: Superior item or extra item! | Success: Well-made item. | Failure: Inferior item. | Botch: Waste Resources: lost materials! | . A Superior tool raises the bonus to Checks made with it by two, a weapon raises to hit and damage bonus by one, and armor has one lower Load. The opposite is true for Inferior outcomes, so lower the bonus by two for tools, one for weapon hit and damage, or add 1 Load to Armor. Fellowship . Even successful adventure is harrowing, reflected largely by WP loss. Characters can avoid isolation and despair by bonding with and supporting each other via Fellowship. For example, they may buy a round of beer and cheer their traumatized friend at the bar, have a long and insightful discussion, romantic interlude, cathartic argument, or a friendly brawl. During Fellowship, each player involved gets WP back. Fellowship is a Strongest-Link Skilled Cha Check vs. the lowest current WP in the group. Look to films, books, and movies for examples of this. Check: Cha vs. WP (current lowest). OCS: counseling, carousing, humor careers. | Critical: Everyone involved regains 4 WP! | Success: Everyone involved regains 2 WP. | Failure: Everyone involved regains only 1 WP. | Botch: No one involved regains WP! | . One way to do this is to have characters ask each other meaningful questions. For example, “What rattled you so badly during our last fight”, “Why do you drink when I bring up my hometown?”, “What were you talking about with that shady customer back in the shop?” The answers do not need to be honest or even answered at all. If the players seem to be managing Fellowship without questions, ignore this method and enjoy the drama. For Fellowship to work, there must be more than one character involved. If the group is fractious, different cliques may have separate Fellowship scenes with each other. Those using their Montage for other Actions miss out on the WP recovery. Recovery . Staggered or Fallen characters may recover with time and proper care. This is a Check of Wis vs. the local Travel DF, Disease DF, or negative HP of the patient, whichever is greater. OCS related to medicine grant their d20. Success just means stability for now, only a Critical clears a Status. The character making the Check decides which available Status they clear or accidentally inflict. Check: Wis vs. DF of local Travel, Disease, or -HP. OCS: herbalist, healer, doctor, surgeon, etc. | Critical: Clear Staggered or Fallen! | Success: Stable, no change until next Montage. | Failure: Inflict Staggered, Fallen, or Dead. | Botch: Dead! | . Fallen characters get a Check to recover on their own while laid out. This uses their End instead of Wis and a d12 instead of a d20 - there are no OCS that apply while unconscious! . Note that a Staggered and Fallen character may as well Gambit on a failure. They die just the same on a Failure or Botch. Think of this as a free chance. Research . Wise adventurers traveling to odd places should prepare themselves for what might come. A night or two in the library, consulting with experts, or hanging around listening to gossip and tall tales can mean the difference between victory and doom. After spending a Montage on Research, they learn a vital piece of info, or two pieces with a related OCS. They also get a temporary Skill on the topic of interest. This temporary Skill does not imply depth of knowledge, so it only lasts until they enjoy a Success or Critical with it. After that, they have gone beyond the reach of their cram session. Usually, a library, guild, or city will suffice. Listening to other party members or reading a book can work too. Encourage party members to “share” Skills this way, even if they are only temporary. A character can only have one temporary Skill from Research at a time. If they take a liking to it, they may swap out one of their current Skills for it, plug it into an unused slot if under three Skills, or use Training Montages to take it on as a new Skill. In the last case, the Research Montage counts as one prior Training Montage. Shopping . This gives a chance for characters with bargaining talent to shine while keeping this sort of scene from dragging on too long. This Montage sums up an entire shopping spree. Zoomed-in haggling attempts are better off framed as Parley. Shopping Checks a relevant bargaining OCS +Cha against the merchant’s WP. Most merchants want to make sales, so the DF usually hovers at 10. All characters who want in on this add items to the shopping list and hand over the money. Check: Cha vs. variable DF (usually 10). OCS: merchant, craftsman, antiques, lore, etc. | Critical: get major free item(s)! | Success: get minor free item(s). | Failure: shopping goes as planned. | Botch: Waste: missing or poor-quality items! | . The bonus items are things shopkeepers threw in to sweeten the deal. A minor item might be a few extras or an interesting freebie. A major item might be many extras, info, or a fine quality tool. In any case, it shouldn’t seem like either side is getting ripped off; that is what Parley is for. Good Imp practice is to have the merchants give them things they did not realize they would need. Training . Characters can gain new Skills by sheer diligence. A new Skill takes up a number of training Montages equal to half their current Skills, rounded up. For example, someone with 5 Skills would need 3 Training Montages to get a new one. A teacher or mentor with a relevant Class, Origin, or the same Skill makes each Montage count as two. Travel . Handling long journeys as the opening of a new scene is the norm. For example, “After many days on the road, you come across the town of…” You may opt for this Montage when the journey is as important as the destination. Players to plot their own way, and the Imp gets a chance for drama. Travel is a Weakest-link Agi Check, aided by navigation or local knowledge OCS. Success moves into the destination safely and failure means an Encounter with a foe or dramatic event. Make up your own Encounters or use a random table keyed to your game world. Check: Agi vs. DF of named Zone (weakest-link). OCS: local knowledge, wilderness, etc. | Critical: enter next point safely in half the time! | Success: enter next point safely. | Failure: enter next point but face an Encounter. | Botch: lost: Encounter plus enter wrong point! | . Other good Criticals include finding supplies, a treasure, a shortcut, a scenic view, or a helpful NPC. Other good Botches include ambushes while asleep, natural disasters, losing supplies, etc. Eldritch Gambit assumes you are using “point-crawl” maps where interesting areas are “points” with paths connecting them shown as lines between. The more detail in a map, the riskier it is to travel. For example, a party heading to the “inverted city of the ant-king” might cross through the deadly “sawgrass plains (DF 15)” to get there. Heading into a town or dungeon within a point rarely calls for a Check. Travel to a point can take hours, days, or weeks depending on the scale of the map. Write the travel time on the connecting line, such as “2 days” or “1d4 days.” Time is based on a walking party, roughly 6 km (5 miles) per day, half in rough terrain. Mounts may halve this on terrain they are suited for, and vehicles may allow otherwise idle passengers to take other Montage Actions. Point-crawls are meant to highlight, not restrict. if the party wants to go somewhere that is not a point, “drop a pin” there and make it one. Adventurers “travel on their stomachs.” They suffer the effects of Deprivation (Hunger, Thirst, and Fatigue) if they do not plan their journey well. ",

    "doc": "Scenes",
    "title": "Scenery",
    "content": "These are not Scenes themselves, but add-ons, features, or twists that make one more interesting. A good part of many adventures deals with inanimate or “ambient” perils, such as fire, falls from great heights, disease, etc. Cover . A character can protect themselves from attacks and notice using the local environs as cover. There are two broad types to consider: Soft Cover and Hard Cover. They may declare they are taking any available Cover in the current Zone at the beginning of their Action. If they move out of Cover, they lose its benefit. | Soft Cover conceals but does not bar movement, like darkness or underbrush. It inflicts a penalty to target a character within it with Attacks, Spells, etc. reliant on vision. | Hard Cover prevents most attacks into or out of it. A character may pop out of Hard Cover to target someone, but others may now target them with a -4 penalty until their next Action. | . COVER . | Examples | Type | Penalty | . | Moonlight, branches | Soft | -2 | . | Total darkness, brush | Soft | -4 | . | Wall, boulder, tree | Hard | -4* | . *only after targeting another from Hard Cover . Whether a target has Cover depends on where the attacker is coming from. For example, a stone wall only provides Cover against those on the other side. Disease . It is always a mystery when and how one fell ill to a disease. In the next Montage or so after exposure, potential victims get a free Recovery Check vs. its DF to see if they stay healthy. Leave them to ponder the when, how, and why of it their infection. This Recovery Check abides by the usual outcomes: A success means they are stable and do not fall ill, a failure that they become Staggered or worse. Proper care, hygiene or medicine will grant a bonus. SAMPLE DISEASES . | Disk Horse: sufferers first lose the ability to have fun, then spew irate and ill-formed arguments. Death comes as they melt down into a heap of bubbling flesh, much to everyone’s relief. DF 10. | Hobbititis: spreads by intimate contact. Instead of dying, the infected gain the Small Size Trait, hair in odd places, and a voracious appetite. DF 15. | Mauve Hork: spreads seasonally, with sufferers “horking” up gobs of thick, stringy pinkish-purple mucus. It is weak but endemic; even healthy characters can catch it if they linger too long in an infected area. DF 5. | . Deprivation . Even amidst fantastic perils, it is still possible for adventurers to suffer from mundane thirst, hunger, fatigue, and suffocation. Every day, a normal human adventurer needs one ration, a full water skin, six hours of decent rest, and ample air. Lacking these can have real effects: . | Fatigue: each full day without rest inflicts a -1 penalty to all Checks. Several days of poor sleep can also cause this. A full day of rest removes this effect. One can describe Botches while fatigued as delirium or simply falling asleep. | Hunger: each full and active day without food inflicts a -1 penalty to all Rolls. A full day of eating freely relieves this penalty. One can describe any negative Roll results as fainting. | Suffocation: a character can hold their breath for 1d12 +End Rounds before Incapacitation. Afterward, they get another such Roll for the Rounds before death. If they had time to breathe and prepare, use the max on the die. Resuscitation is a Recovery Check (Wis vs. the # of Rounds after Incapacitation). | Thirst: each full day without water inflicts a -2 penalty to Rolls and Checks. A full day of drinking freely cures this. | . These are not very heroic ways to go and are here to give a good reason to buy rations, water, or a stay at the inn. This sort of “resource management” is a sub-game some players really enjoy. Falling . The ignoble doom of the unlucky and unsung. Falls inflict 1d6 damage per 5-meter zone fallen, up to 10d6. For reference, consider each Zone about the height of a story or floor on a modern building. Other hazards potentially lurking at the bottom, like spikes or acid would inflict their own damage as well. A daring character may Plummet onto an enemy below, adding another 1d6 damage to their Attack and subtracting a die from their own fall damage. Creatures of larger Size take more falling damage. Multiply the falling damage by their HP multiple in the Size chart. Fire . Fire is hot and does not need much explanation. | A small fire like a torch does 1d6 damage | A medium one like a campfire does 2d6 | A large one the size of a bonfire does 3d6. | . An especially flammable target like someone soaked in oil takes on the Burning Status. This means it takes 1d6 damage again at the top of each Round. They or an ally can spend a Use action to smother the flames, roll around, use water, etc. One cannot Rally while burning, for obvious reasons. Mobs . Lumped groups of similar foes, such as a pack of wolves or a squadron of soldiers. The Imp can treat them as a Mob, sharing one HP pool equal to a single member. A Felling blow removes a single member from the pool instead of inflicting damage. Area attacks are an exception; if these inflict a Felling blow, the entire Mob falls. This frees the Imp from tracking multiple pesky HP pools. Players may not even notice, as its effects are similar to the common tactic of always attacking the unlucky foe with the lowest HP. Mounts . Riding atop a mount like a horse or wyvern is a distinct advantage. In combat, the mount and rider count as a single unit. A rider may use the mount’s movement, but the two share the same Action. Otherwise, treat them as separate characters. Targeting a rider with an Attack incurs a -2 Cover penalty. If the Mount is more than one Size level larger, Melee attacks will require climbing up on the Mount. This feat takes one Move for each Size level greater than the Attacker. For example, trying to punch a foe riding on the head of a colossal tyrannosaurus rex calls for a bit of a hike. Relevant OCS for riding can be used with Cha to get the mount to do something it ordinarily would not. For example, leaping over an obstacle, learning a trick, running to exhaustion, or just not fleeing a battlefield. Proper training ensures these things do not need a Check, such as a warhorse inured to the chaos of battle. Poison . Doom may come from agents more subtle than powerful: a tainted drink, a hidden needle, a viper’s fang. When exposed to poison, Roll its Buildup die at the top of the next Round. This stacks but does not count as damage. If the total Buildup exceeds the Base HP of the target, they suffer the Effect. | Exposure is either Inhaled, Ingested or Injury. | Buildup is usually 1d6. Poisoned is a Status, so just write your current Buildup result next to it. | Effect: nonlethal poisons vary, but normally inflict the Incapacitated Status. Lethal poisons always inflict the Fallen Status. | . Multiple doses applied at once still only inflict a single Buildup Roll per round, but these continue each Round until the doses run out. Buildup fades away next Scene if no longer exposed or there are no Buildup dice left to Roll. An antidote or other cure halves Buildup immediately. This ends Status effects if it drops back below their Base HP. A “slow” poison builds up over Montage Scenes instead of Rounds. This can model things like an unhealthy miasma spreading through a city, or a slowly acting poison in the royal goblet. SAMPLE POISONS . | Cave Fumes: Those who delve too deep into these scentless but unwholesome vapors soon fall drowsy and die. Exposure: Inhaled, Buildup: 1d6 per Round. Effect: Fallen. | Somber Resin: Applying this concoction to a weapon is a Use Action. There are rumors of specially grooved Assassin’s blades that can deliver more doses in a single hit. Exposure: Injury, Buildup: 1d6 per hit. Effect: Fallen. | Mad Cap: this mushroom is harmless and delicious if cooked properly. Eaten raw, it inflicts wildly terrifying yet unenlightening hallucinations. Exposure: Ingestion, Buildup: 1d6 per drink. Effect: Incapacitated. | . Traps . Sinister devices like pits, darts, and snares left as a defense to harm intruders. Traps make exploration feel perilous and uncertain. A trap triggers after a specific event, such as stepping on a pressure plate or entering a room. No one needs to declare they are keeping an eye out for traps. Assume everyone is doing as best they can. Most traps are obstacles, avoided with the usual Move Check. Every PC gets to choose how they deal with it, however. For example, one may try to leap (Move) before falling into a pit trap or jam the hinge with their weapon (Attack). Prior warnings can grant a bonus, or even a penalty if the info was deceptive. If a trap is known, the party may just avoid it. Traps can be dull if they just go off with no way to interact with them! For this reason, there should be signs or clues nearby such as bloodstains, dead animals, scratches, graffiti, etc. Many have a “Safety” mechanism to save even those who failed their Check. Otherwise, traps would decimate unwary dungeon denizens. For example, a pit trap might have a tell-tale noise that gives a second to jump away. A flooding room trap might have a riddle revealing where to find the lever to deactivate it, etc. Traps without tell-tale signs or safeties certainly exist, but they are not as much fun for Players to “solve.” . Deactivate traps with a Use Check and relevant OCS. For example, a hunter could easily deal with snares, a burglar with doorknob needles, etc. Parties may come up with other ways to escape or avoid traps, and you should reward creative ideas instead of forcing them to play out the trap as written. This is especially true of powerful parties with lots of experience. Let them enjoy their power! . EXAMPLE TRAPS . | Pitfall: a carefully weighted trapdoor covers a shaft down to the next floor. Though triggered by the first one to walk across it, nearby party members could also blunder in. Safety: none. DF 10, 2d6 Falling damage to all in Zone. | Scything blade: a pressure plate in the hallway triggers a massive hidden blade to swing towards the victim. Safety: the victim hears a metallic whirring at head height and has a split second to get horizontal and avoid decapitation. DF 15, 3d6 damage to the lead character. | Flooding room: this small adjoining room has a strange idol in the center. If players linger, the doors closes and it begins to fill with water, flooding entirely in 5 Action Rounds Safety: kneeling before the idol drains the water. DF 20, Drowning damage only. | . TRAP BUILDER . | Scale of Effect | Dice | . | - Hits single target | 3d6 | . | - Hits all in the same Zone. | 2d6 | . | - Hits all in center &amp; adjacent Zones | 1d6 | . | Options: |   | . | - Safety Mechanism | +1d6 | . | - Inflicts Poison or Disease | -1d6 | . | - Causes Grappled status | -1d6 | . | - Causes Burning status | -1d6 | . | - DF 5 | +1d6 | . | - DF 15 | -1d6 | . | - DF 20 | -2d6 | . | - Fall damage | as Fall | . | - Drowning | none | . A jury-rigged trap uses d4s instead of d6, while a masterwork trap deals d8s. Nothing is keeping an Imp from using different values. The guidelines here just keep the trap within the realm of a solid threat, neither hopelessly deadly nor laughably weak. ",

    "content": "Eldritch Gambit is a fantasy RPG toolkit. It’s innards are derived from classic fantasy RPG rules; easy to pick up for new gamers and familiar to experienced ones. As such, most things in-game boil down to the tried-and-true method of rolling as high as you can on the dice. Players are not entirely at the mercy of their dice, however. Eldritch Gambit differs from other games in its lineage by granting more freedom to players. As part of this goal, it features a variety of “push-your-luck” mini-games that encourage making choices over merely accepting results. You can find Eldritch_Gambit at DriveThruRPG and Itch.io. To ask questions, provide feedback, or just talk about what you are doing with Eldritch Gambit, check out our Twitter, Discord, or Facebook sites. ",
