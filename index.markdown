**Eldritch Gambit** is a fantasy RPG toolkit. It's innards are derived from classic fantasy RPG rules; easy to pick up
for new gamers and familiar to experienced ones. As such, most things
in-game boil down to the tried-and-true method of rolling as high as you
can on the dice.

Players are not entirely at the mercy of their dice, however. Eldritch
Gambit differs from other games in its lineage by granting more freedom
to players. As part of this goal, it features a variety of “push-your-luck”
mini-games that encourage making choices over merely accepting results.
