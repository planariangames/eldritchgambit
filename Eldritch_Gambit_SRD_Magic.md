## Spells

A Spell is a supernatural power made possible by permanent magical tools
called ***Materia***, expendable ***Ephemera***
, or from an inborn ***Trait***. Regardless of method, anyone who can
cast a Spell is a ***Caster***.

### Range

A condition of willing imagination into reality is applying limits to
the space it can affect. Every Spell has a Range in the usual Zones.
Range:0 means it affects self or other in the same Zone, and Range:1 or
more means it can reach that many Zones out.

Casters can concentrate and double the Range on a Spell if it uses a
Check. This lowers the Check to a d12 as usual, just like aiming a
ranged weapon.

### Duration

Magic may be eternal, but time has meaning, and attention has limits. A
spell either takes place all at once or requires focus to prolong.

- **Instant** Spells end after casting. Consequences such as burning
ships, healed wounds, etc. remain.
- **Lasting** Spells end when dispelled, if the caster discards the magic
item, if they choose a new target for that Spell, or just decide it is
over.

A caster can maintain any Lasting Spells they can *currently* cast, even
all of them at once. If the caster wants to maintain a Lasting Spell on
more than one target, they must have that many “copies” of it.

### Elements

Damage-inflicting Spells may have an Element as a prefix, such as Bolt,
Cold, Fire, etc. For example, a *Fire Blast* could be a gout of flame,
red hot lance, or a howling magma bat. An Elemental Spell is more
effective against those vulnerable to the Element and less effective
against those resistant to it. If there is no Elemental prefix for a
damage-inflicting Spell, it does regular physical damage.<span

**COMMON ELEMENTS**

{: .lh-0}
| Element | Tag Effects                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| Bolt    | Electricity, lightning, etc.            |
| Cold    | Freezing winds, ice attacks, etc.       |
| Fire    | Flames, hellfire, radiation, etc.       |
| Void    | Disintegration, micro-black holes, etc. |

### Cantrips

Casters may use almost any Spell casually to achieve more minor effects,
called ***Cantrips***. For example, a Caster with a version of
*Blast\[Fire\]* that could reduce a man to ashes could instead light a
room with a flickering mote of flame or lay down a magical spiral sigil
to heat a cooking pot. These can aid a narrative action, improve
outcomes, and act as tools. They should not approach the effects of a
more suitable Spell, however.

### Spell Descriptions

The following covers many Spells that may or may not be available in
your setting. Their titles are intentionally generic, as they are just aspects
 of the Materia or Ephemera they belong to. To make these more flavorful and
 interesting, tie them to their item in a creative way.

**LIST OF SPELLS**

- **Abjure:** subtle mental defenses. *<span
class="smallcaps">WP</span>*-affecting Spell Checks targeting the caster
must score a Critical to take effect. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Incoming
<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span> vs. WP Spells need a Critical to take
effect.*
- **Adhere:** selectively sticky. After casting this Spell, climbing
(Move), or Grapple Actions drop to half DF. Other Actions aided by
adhesion may also benefit. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Half DF for climbing
(Move) and Grapple Checks.*
- **Attract:** a powerful force holds in all who enter a Zone. This is an
un-Checked Grapple Action with the Spell Rolling 1d8+<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> Grapple versus the Roll of everyone in that
Zone. This Grapples any losers as usual, but the Caster suffers no
effect if they lose. *\[Range 0, Instant\] 1d8 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> Grapple Roll vs. all in Zone.*
- **Backlash:** unwary attackers will face retribution.
The caster or target can use 1d12 +CHA on melee clashes instead of their usual weapon.
Often uses an Element tag.
*\[Range 0, Lasting\] 1d12 +CHA for melee clashes.*
- **Burst:** fires a lethal spread over an area. This automatically hits
everyone in the Zone, friend or foe, for 1d8 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> damage. Elements can make this Spell more
interesting. *\[Range 2, Instant\] 1d8 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> damage to all in target Zone.*
- **Barrier:** calls up a wall or other obstacle. This provides Hard Cover
and a DF 10 + <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span> obstacle versus those
trying to Move in or out of the zone it blocks. *\[Range 1, Lasting\]
Creates Hard Cover, obstacle DF is 10 +*<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span>*.*
- **Berserk:** a strike that hungers for more blood. If this Melee Attack
results in a Felling Blow, make another free Melee Attack on another foe
in the same Zone. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Free Melee Attack afterward if a
Felling Blow.*
- **Blast:** fires off a powerful magical ranged attack, usually paired
with an Element tag. This is a Ranged Attack for 1d12 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> damage. Reskinning can make this Spell more
interesting. *\[Range 2, Instant\] Ranged Attack, 1d12 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> damage.*
- **Cache:** Store items weightlessly in a weird space pocket and retrieve
them at will. This stores up to 10 +<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span>
Load. Putting something in or taking it out is a Use Action, or a
Grapple for the unwilling. If the Spell ends the contents spill out.
*\[Range 0, Lasting\] Store up to 10 +<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span>
Load.*
- **Charm:** A mesmerizing aura makes the caster very convincing to
others. This halves the DF for mundane <span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span>-based Checks such as Parley and Perform. It
is dangerous to overuse, as targets may come to realize they were under
your influence later. *\[Range 1, Instant\] Half DF for mundane <span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> Checks.*
- **Commune:** telepathically links a group of willing minds who may
“speak” to each other silently, at any distance, with no language
barrier. This links up to ten plus the caster’s <span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> minds until they or the Caster cut their
connection. The Range of zero only applies when adding minds. *\[Range
0, Lasting\] Telepathically link up to 10 +*<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> *minds.*
- **Confuse:** The caster’s banter and gestures bewilder the target. This
is a Parley (<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span> vs WP) inflicting the
Confuse status if successful. *\[Range 1, Lasting\] Parley Check to
Confuse target.*
- **Copy:** soaks up the flavor of incoming magics. The caster can copy
any Spell that targeted or affected them while active. The new Spell
replaces the Copy Spell until ended. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Copy any
Spell that affected the caster.*
- **Cure:** transmutes toxins. Roll 1d12 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> and reduce poison Buildup by that amount.
If this drops Buildup below the target’s Base HP, any non-lethal
(Incapacitated, etc.) Status inflicted by the poison ends. Also purifies
food and drink. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Reduce Buildup by 1d12 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha.</span>*
- **Deadeye:** Guidance from beyond. If this Attack fails, a following
gambit to avoid failure is vs. half the target’s actual AF. *\[Range 0,
Instant\] If the Attack Fails, half AF on Gambit to succeed.*
- **Disguise:** temporarily alters the target’s Description, i.e., facial
features, skin color, weight, apparent age, sex, etc. This is a Craft
(<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span> vs. WP) Check, but only a Critical
can disguise the unwilling. Dropping or dispelling reverts the target to
their original form. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Craft Check (*<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> *vs. WP) to revise Description.*
- **Edify:** grants expertise in a specific field. Gain the benefits of a
supplemental Career or Origin until the Spell ends. *\[Range 0, Lasting\]
Gain a Career or Origin until ended.*
- **Empathy:** gains insight from the minds of others. This halves the DF
on Insight Checks vs. WP and allows the caster to detect a lie as an
Outcome answer. *\[Range 2, Instant\] Half DF on Insight Checks, may
detect lies outright.*
- **Enfeeble:** causes weakness and uncertainty. This is a Parley Check,
and success means the target must reroll a single die from any Rolls
(damage, Rally, casting dice, etc.) and take the lowest result. *\[Range
1, Lasting\] Parley Check, target Rerolls any Rolls and takes lowest.*
- **Flight:** fly through the air with great speed. Flight is at double normal
speed in any direction. Easily overcomes most obstacles, falls, and ground
hazards without a Check, half DF for the rest. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Fly in any
 direction at double speed.*
- **Float:** glide through the air with the greatest of ease. This easily
overcomes most obstacles, falls, and ground hazards without a Move
Check, and halves DF for the rest. Move actions may be in any direction,
including up. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Negate fall & ground hazards, half DF on Moves vs.
obstacles.*
- **Grease:** covers the ground with a slippery aura. This inflicts a 1d4
+<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span> penalty to nearly any action taken
within the target Zone. Can also be useful for oiling large mechanisms.
*\[Range 1, Lasting\] Zone turns slippery, inflicts 1d4 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> Penalty.*
- **Haste:** save up time from idle moments. This stores the Action it
took to cast as a “free” other Action later. Once used, they may cast it
again to store a new idle Action. Assume casters with this Spell have an
Action stored unless they spent it that Scene. *\[Range 0, Lasting\]
Save an Action for later.*
- **Hazard:** creates a persistent dangerous area, such as a flaming
rampart or a looming sphere of pure nothing. This inflicts 1d6 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> damage to all in or passing through the
target Zone. If another Hazard is cast on the same area, it negates
both. *\[Range 1, Lasting\] All in Zone take 1d6 +<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> damage.*
- **Heal:** fixing delicate organisms with magic is far more difficult
than blasting them to bits or turning them into frogs. Nevertheless,
Healing magic allows impossible feats of medicine, halving the DF of
Recovery Checks. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Half DF for Recovery Checks.*
- **Hold:** move things from a distance. The caster can take regular
Actions like Attack, Grapple, or Use from a Zone away, using <span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> instead of <span
class="smallcaps">Str</span>. If grappling, the caster does not take
damage back from the target’s Grapple Roll-off. *\[Range 1, Instant\]
Act at range using <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span> as <span
class="smallcaps">Str</span>.*
- **Imbue:** create Materia and Ephemera. This allows the use of the
caster’s crafting-related OCS to create magic items related to it. For
example, a Blacksmith Career could create magic weapons, armor, or tools.
This takes up resources and a Crafting Montage, as well as a Quest if
the item is a Materia. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Craft Ephemera and
Materia.*
- **Imperil:** dulls the ability to react to danger. This is a Parley
Check, success halves the target’s AF until ended. *\[Range 1, Lasting\]
Parley Check to halve target’s AF.*
- **Insulate:** a subtle but effective buffer against attacks with Element
tags, such as Fire, Bolt, Void, etc. They are also comfortable in
extreme weather even if not dressed for it. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] half
damage from Elements<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">.</span>*
- **Morph:** changes the target into the specified creature, such as
turning a human into a frog or a chicken into a dragon. Each Template is
a different Spell. This is a Check of <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span>
vs. WP, with Success applying the Template to a willing target and a
Critical to an unwilling one. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Check <span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> vs. WP to replace Template.*
- **Patch:** fills and bolsters a grievous injury, negating its effect
temporarily. This works on anything that can Stagger, even undead and
constructs. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Negate Stagger while active.*
- **Phase:** walk through solid objects and even people. This is a Move
Action that automatically passes obstacles and walls but cannot end in a
Zone filled with solid matter. It does not protect the caster from
physical attacks. There are variants of this Spell that look more like a
short teleport. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Move action that passes obstacles
and walls.*
- **Pierce:** bypasses or ignores armor. This is a Ranged Attack
inflicting damage equal to the target’s Rally die +*<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span>*. *\[Range 2, Instant\] Ranged Attack for
target’s Rally die +<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span> dmg.*
- **Protect:** deflects peril in desperate situations. The caster takes
half damage from a Felling blow, ending this Spell. Can be recast later
for further protection. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Felling blow does half
damage.*
- **Purge** mystical tricks to mend the damage to reality caused by other
Spells. This grants a d20 to Dispel Checks even if the dispeller does
not have the same Spell. *\[Range 1, Instant\] Dispel Checks always use
d20.*
- **Repel:** a wave of force pushes others away. This is an un-Checked
Grapple (Push) Action inflicting 1d8 +<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span>
Grapple damage to all in the target Zone. Any “losers” who fail the
Grapple Roll-off are pushed one Zone away from the target. Unlike a
regular Grapple, the caster does not take damage in return if they lose
the Roll-off. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Resist 1d8+<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> Grapple Roll-off or shift one Zone away.*
- **Scry:** The caster may peer into a remote location. This allows an
Insight Action about what is going on in an area of interest. This area
can be of any distance away, but anyone within gets the eerie feeling of
“being watched.” Those in the location with may target the caster with
WP-affecting Spells. *\[Range 0, Instant\] use Insight Action about
target area.*
- **Séance:** the dead speak to you in their subtle way. When in a Zone
with the remains of sentient beings, the caster makes an Insight Check
on *<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span>* vs. the mortal WP of the local
dead (usually 11). The answers depend on what those who died in this
area could know. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Question the dead with a <span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span> Insight Check.*
- **Seeker:** fires a guided magical bolt, usually paired with an Element
tag. This is a Ranged Attack inflicting 1d8 +*<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span>* damage. If the caster misses and wants to
use a Gambit, halve the target’s AF for the Gambit. *\[Range 2,
Instant\] Ranged Attack for 1d8 + <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha</span>
dmg, if a miss, half AF on Gambit.*
- **Shell:** Surrounds the caster with a force field. The caster or target
gains Armor (AP) equal to 10 plus their *<span
class="smallcaps">Cha</span>*. This does not stack with worn armor or
increase the Rally die. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Armor AP equal to 10*
+*<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cha.</span>*
- **Smite:** a surge of incredible might. This Action imbues the target’s
next <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Str</span> Roll with an extra die of the
same type. After the Roll, this Spell ends. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Add a
die to an upcoming <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Str</span> Roll.*
- **Spring:** leap into the air like a moon jump. This lets the caster or
target take their usual Move in any direction, halving fall damage and DF
for most obstacles. The character must land each Round. *\[0, Lasting\] Move in any
direction, halve fall damage and DF for obstacles.*
- **Summon:** creates an obedient semi-real servant of the caster’s own
design. Create an NPC with a Threat Base equal to the Caster’s level divided by
 four, rounded up as usual. They can take on Load from Traits up to their Threat
 base, but their Template must have the Unstable Trait (-2 Load) and cannot
 include their own Innate Summon Spells.  A
summon disappears when fallen or dispelled but can be resummoned. Design
this creature outside of game time as not to interrupt play. *\[Range 0,
Lasting\] Calls up creature with a total Threat (Base + Load) of ¼
caster Level.*
- **Sustain:** fuels the needs of the body. Those under this Spell do not
suffer from thirst, hunger, fatigue, or suffocation. This Spell does not
fix existing Deprivation effects. It just keeps them from accumulating.
*\[Range 0, Lasting\] Cannot gain new Deprivation effects.*
- **Teleport:** snaps the caster back to a preset location. This is cast
while in the target Zone. At the beginning of any of their later
Actions, the caster may instantly return to it with anything they are
carrying. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Sets a Zone that can be returned to
instantly later.*
- **Vanish:** An illusion makes the target invisible. This is a Sneak
Action at half the usual DF that also grants Soft Cover (-4). Other
Actions do not gain this benefit. *\[Range 0, Instant\] Soft Cover (-4
to hit), Sneak Check at half DF.*
- **Vorpal:** a devastating and savage attack that seeks out the weak
points of a foe. If it succeeds, the following Gambit for a Critical
Success is vs half AF. *\[Range 0, Instant\] If the Attack succeeds,
half AF on the Gambit to Critical.*
- **Zombify:** raise a nearby corpse as an undead servant. They arise as a
Zombie with a Threat Base equal to the Caster’s
level divided by four, rounded up as usual. Zombies keep their original
gear and Traits but lose their Concepts. They gain the Undead (0 Load)
and Unstable (-2 Load) Traits. A Fallen or dispelled zombie cannot be
reanimated. *\[Range 0, Lasting\] Raises undead servant with Threat Base
of ¼ caster Level.*

### DIY Spells

If reskinning an existing Spell does not cut it, you can make one from
scratch using the existing ones as guidance. A popular method is to give
those using the Spell half DF at something specific and add a little
extra something for fun. If especially powerful, you may want to limit
its use or give it interesting drawbacks. If it is integral to the
setting it may work better as an Artifact.

## Materia

A Materia is an item permanently imbued with magical power. These grant
their wielder one or more Spells to cast at will. For example, a sword
that can burst into flame, a flying broom, a wolf tattoo that springs to
life, etc.

Casters must spend a single WP to attune their minds with a Materia
before they can cast its Spells. This WP does not come back until they
discard the item or someone else spends a WP to wield it.

Most are found, stolen, or granted. Few are made or bought. Prices vary
wildly in the rare places they are offered, and the risk to the seller
is astronomical. The Insight Check to reveal the Spells in an a found
Materia is usually vs. DF 10. Using WP also reveals the Spells but is
less useful when divvying up loot.

### Crafting Materia

To create a Materia, a character with the *Imbue* Spell must create a
Superior version of that item (Critical). They must also incorporate a
symbolic item that reflects the intended Spell(s). For example, a Roc
feather for a flying carpet or the last breath of a king for a crown of
necromancy. This component must be dearly bought with a worthy Quest.
Symbolic components gained too easily lack the metaphysical gravitas to
fuel Materia.

Poetry aside, the DF for this Crafting Check is the same as creating an
item of its type, i.e., five plus the maximum on the damage or Rally
die. This results in an item that grants one Spell. An item can be
imbued with more than one Spell by adding the max die again for each.
Miscellaneous non-combat items like wands or capes typically count as
1d4, making them prime targets for enchantment.

A Materia may be reforged into a different item type at the same
difficulty, without a new Quest.

{: .text-center}
**EXAMPLE MATERIA**

- **Codswallop:** A flail shaped like a fish. The scales can move on their
own for a devastating chainsaw effect. Reaching into its mouth reveals
an extradimensional hiding place for all manner of goods. **Spells:**
*Cache, Smite*.
- **Dormant Demon:** partial possession by an indolent entity blocks other
mental intrusions. Just hope it doesn’t wake up. **Spell:** *Abjure.*
- **Ember of the First Flame:** A still-burning coal stolen from the first
fire of the gods, before it was made harmful to man. When laid on the
chest of the ill or maimed, its primordial warmth suffuses them with
life. **Spell:** *Heal.*
- **Flying Carpet:** a small fine carpet that unrolls and floats on
command. If passengers also ride, their Load applies to the owner as if
carried. **Spells:** *Float, Flight.*
- **Halo Cutter:** this glowing golden halo hovers over the bearer’s head,
shedding light as a lamp. More importantly, it protects their soul from
outside influences and can swoop out to dismember those who offend.
**Spells:** *Abjure, Seeker.*
- **Hand of Glory:** This Candelabra made from a hideous waxy dead hand is
the envy of every thief or ambitious intruder. Pressing it against an
obstacle allows the wielder to pass through to the other side like a
ghost. **Spell:** *Phase.*
- **Necropants:** an ugly pair of pants made from human skin. Grants
incredible speed and has unnaturally deep pockets. **Spells:** *Spring,
Cache.*
- **Thighbone Flute:** this macabre musical instrument has three special
tunes. One disorients listeners, one blasts them away from the wielder
with a wall of sound, and one controls an undead servant. **Spells:**
*Confuse, Zombify, Repel.*

##  Ephemera

Small expendable items imbued with power. They enable any sentient being
to cast a single Spell one or more times but break when it ends. For
example, drinking a potion, using a scroll, firing an arrow, etc. The
Spell uses the wielder’s Attributes, and otherwise counts as originating
from them.

Ephemera tend to be small compact items of negligible weight, priced at
about 100 cp each. Scrolls and potions are popular, but many creators
punch things up by crafting them out of more thematic ingredients.
Selling them nets half price at best. The Insight Check to reveal the
Spell in a found Ephemera is usually vs. DF 5, DF10 if exotic or
unfamiliar. Many will have their use written on the label.

Unlike Materia, Ephemera inflict little strain on the mind and do not
lower WP. Unfortunately, they do not hold out for as long either. Those
with Lasting durations end when a new Montage begins.

### Crafting Ephemera

To create or add a charge to an Ephemera, one needs the ability to cast
the Imbue Spell and the desired Spell. This is a Crafting Check, usually
<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Wis</span> vs. the local Travel DF. Criticals
yield an extra Ephemera. Creating an Ephemera eats up about 50 cp each
time due to materials.

{: .text-center}
**EXAMPLE EPHEMERA**

- **Black Meat:** a dried strip of dark oily flesh from some awful
interdimensional centipede. Its taste is repugnant but fascinating,
heightening senses exponentially as the mind tries to correlate the
contents of the mouth. **Spell:** *Alarm*.
- **Blade Pitch:** the contents of this sulfurous sachet alight when
rubbed across a weapon, turning it into a brand of fire. **Spells:**
*Smite \[Fire\].*
- **Blessed Larva:** an enchanted cocoon in a small woven basket. If it
successfully Purges the magic, it hatches and flies away as a full-grown
moth. If it fails, it crumbles into ash. **Spell:** *Purge*.
- **Crimson Cap:** this vivid red mushroom sends the eater into a fighting
trance. **Spell:** *Berserk.*
- **Horse Chestnut:** hurl this to the ground and a vegetal horse arises.
Good for a quick escape but obstinately plants itself into the ground
when its time runs out. **Spell:** *Summon \[Riding Horse\].*
- **Mordant Herb:** this bitter leaf counteracts poison and disease when
properly enchanted. **Spell:** *Cure.*
- **Portal Chalk:** a bit of chalk. The caster draws a door, setting that
place as the destination. Later, they can draw another and step back
through the original destination door. **Spell:** *Teleport.*
- **Pyrocart:** a chunky copper cartridge that loads into a flame Staff.
**Spell:** *Blast*.
- **Star-squid egg cluster:** this cluster of hard nacreous globules
hardly registers as a living thing, but when hurled down forcefully it
erupts into a maelstrom of flailing tentacles. It is rumored that new
dormant clusters appear in the wreckage years later. **Spell:**
*Hazard*.
- **That’s It in a Nutshell:** the final word of a dying mystic, revealing
the secret to life, the universe, and everything. When cracked open,
thunder and trumpets peal from beyond, drowning out the words of
enlightenment and hurling bystanders out of reach. **Spell:** *Repel.*
- **Thorn of Agony:** this clove-like thorn brings renewed vigor when
driven into the flesh of an injured ally. This is unspeakably painful
and does no favors for their friendship. **Spell:** *Heal.*

##  Artifacts

These are fundamental magical flaws, laws, glitches, or events in the
game setting, far beyond the mischief of a Spell. Their effects can be
absolute and unfair, such as a youth-granting fountain, a perilous cubic
void, random distortions in time, etc. Others may even seem trivial or
random, such as cooking the perfect boiled egg. Artifacts are so diverse
they are best left to narration; some affect the workings of entire
planets. They can break characters, games, or worlds. They are supposed
to.

There is usually only one such Artifact in the setting, and the owner
may attract a great deal of attention just for having it. Most are more
trouble than they are worth. Those that are sentient and don’t get along
with their bearer may withhold power to chastise them. Some have
unpalatable motives of their own, such as world destruction, ranch
dressing, utter conformity, etc.

Those taking the great risk of selling an Artifact can name their price.
The Insight Check to reveal what an unfamiliar found Artifacts does is
usually vs. DF 15. Those that can communicate are usually more than
eager to reveal it that way.

An Artifact may also be a Materia, but this is just begging for trouble.


{: .text-center}
**EXAMPLE ARTIFACTS**

- **Gold Verbena:** this auric herb pops up every spring in a random patch
of dirt. The eater transforms into any creature they desire and stays
that way until it is eaten by a new finder next spring. This works like
the Morph Spell but cannot be dispelled or dropped. Powerful figures
seek this herb out in a bloody yearly contest.
- **Infinity Lance:** this long black pole extends into infinity when a
button on its handle is pressed, piercing all in its way for 1d6x10
damage before snapping back to its original length. Occupied planets and
interstellar beings are few and far between, so the chances of
accidentally impaling one and provoking a war are… probably slim?
- **Shakedown Monument:** this is life-sized statue of one man holding
another upside down, with coins falling out of his pockets. When
touched, it takes the item your character wants most (be honest) from
someone else and teleports it right to them. If the original owner tries
to use the statue to get it back, it disappears forever.
- **Tiny Banjo:** when given to a mouse, it grabs the banjo and does a
pitch perfect impression of Paul Newman singing “Plastic Jesus” from the
movie Cool Hand Luke. It then goes back to being a normal mouse, if
better for the experience. As useless as this sounds, up-and-coming
bards will do about anything to hear the alien melody which has infected
the musical landscape.
