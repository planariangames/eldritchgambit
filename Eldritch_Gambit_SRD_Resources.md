## Money

The easiest thing to do in a game setting is to just base the money on
whatever is familiar to your players. In American games, you might use
“copper pieces” or “cp” as a base and just say 1 cp is about a dollar.
Unless your group is fond of numismatics, this makes dealing with money
easier. That said, a detailed currency can really bring a setting to
life.

Random pockets or treasures may consist of coins with different origins,
weights, metals, and sizes. Silver and gold are popular for high-value
coins.

The price lists shown below are mostly to aid character creation. Do not
feel constrained by these. The real price for anything is whatever the
seller thinks they can get away with charging.



### Treasures

Individual treasures (gems, jewelry, etc.) have a listed value. This is
what the seller gets for them if they do not sweat the details. Those
who choose to Parley may get more or less. If a Treasure is “hot” or
stolen from someone with social standing, the party may have to deal
with a fence to sell it. Fences buy for about half the listed value on a
good day, but characters can always Parley to improve things.

### Other Resources

Aside from coin, there is power in more abstract resources: debts,
promises, emotional baggage, titles of nobility, enemies, hauntings,
alignment to regional factions, family bonds, friendships, your
reputation, tendencies, etc. All are meaningful. These have just as much
right to space in the Resources box of your character sheet as a 10’
pole and change of underwear. These come and go, and their “worth”
depends on how you use them.

##  Miscellaneous

Below are some standard items for fantasy games. This is not meant to be
exhaustive, and most settings should include far more than these.

| Writing kit           | 50   | \-    |

*\* before the slash is empty, after is maximum Load.*

Superior miscellaneous items grant a +2 to any Checks using them but
tend to cost 10 times as much. Inferior ones inflict a -2 penalty and
cost half.

### Kits

These are portable handbags or tool rolls full of the necessities for
certain jobs. For example, treating injuries (Medical kit) or picking
locks (Thieves’ kit). Going without may make tasks impossible or at -4.

### Abstracts

The Resources box is always a good place to write down intangible or
abstract burdens: Debts, vows, promises, curses, obligations, trauma,
etc. These can be valuable as leverage or as things to themselves,
depending on how you play them.

##  Armor

Armor protects the wearer from physical blows. Different armors are
tradeoffs between ***Armor Points (AP), Rally*** dice, and Load. AP adds
directly to maximum HP, Rally is the die size for Rallies, and the Load
column is the encumbrance it inflicts. HP loss does not imply the armor
needs repair, only that it is disheveled until the wearer Rallies and
sorts it out.

One may wear less than the full set of armor. A partial set drops the
effective armor type by one and a minimal set by two. For example, a
chain mail shirt by itself counts as Leather.

{: .text-center}
**STANDARD ARMORS**

{: .lh-0}
| Armor type         | AP  | Rally | Load | cp   |
|:----------------|:---:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|
| None or clothed | \-  | 1d4   | \-   | \-   |
| Leather         | 5   | 1d6   | 1    | 100  |
| Chain mail      | 10  | 1d8   | 2    | 300  |
| Scale mail      | 15  | 1d10  | 3    | 600  |
| Plate mail      | 20  | 1d12  | 4    | 1000 |

Superior Armor is ten times the price but one Load less due to better
mobility and fitting. Inferior Armor is half price but inflicts one Load
more due to bulk and discomfort.

##  Weapons

A weapon inflicts ***Damage*** on a foe, using a die type of d4 to d12.
***Hit*** is the modifier (bonus or penalty) for Attack Actions made
with it (p. [24](#attack-melee)). ***Special*** is any distinctive
features the weapon might have, as described in the legend below the
table), and ***Load*** is the encumbrance of the weapon.

<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Str</span> adds to damage for every listed
weapon. This is true even for bows and crossbows, as these must be set
for a particular <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Str</span>. Anyone weaker
cannot draw or load the bow or crossbow. Futuristic or weird fantasy
weapons like guns, lenses, or blasters may break this rule with set
damage or different Attributes for the damage bonus.

Ranged weapons have a ***Range,*** shown as the number of Zones their
Attacks can reach. You can fire from up to twice as far by dropping the
Attack Check to a d12. One may throw a melee weapon at a target in the
same Zone even if it has no listed range. The advantage is this prevents
clashes on a failure, but the disadvantage is they are no longer
wielding it.

Superior weapons raise to hit and damage by one but are ten times the
price. Inferior weapons are half price but lower to hit and damage by
one.

### Shields

A shield deflects damage, conceals weak spots, and absorbs impact. This
grants a bonus to AF against all physical attacks targeting the wielder.

{: .text-center}
**STANDARD SHIELDS**

{: .lh-0}
| Shield type | Example | AF  | Block | Load | cp  |
|:-------|---------|:---:|:-----:|:----:|:---:|
| Small  | Buckler | +1  | +3    | 0    | 60  |
| Medium | Target  | +2  | +2    | 1    | 80  |
| Large  | Heater  | +3  | +1    | 2    | 120 |

A shield is also a weapon, bashing for 1d6<span
class="smallcaps">+Str</span> damage regardless of size. Shields and
other Blocking weapons aid Melee clashes/failures: add the Block bonus
to the wielder’s Clash damage Roll.

### Ammunition

Ammo is a balancing factor for ranged weapons, so Players should keep
track of their own arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc. They may be
opportunities to scrounge for missed or dropped ammo, and most Imps
should be lenient there.

### Standard Weapons

The table below gives only a sample of common fantasy weapons. If you
have something in mind that is not on this list, improvise using the
values in the table as a reference. All prices listed are for good
fighting quality weapons and assume merchants are ripping eager
adventurers off just a bit. They can easily get an Inferior (-1 to Hit &
damage) weapon for half the price, pick up improvised weapons, or loot
corpses like the hooligans they are.

**2H:** wielded with both hands, precluding the use of a shield or other
weapon. \
**AF:** add this to the AF of the character while wielding this weapon
or shield. \

original damage each Round or lose Action. \
**Grapple:** May use its damage Roll instead of unarmed damage when
Grappling. \

that with a d12. You may throw weapons with no listed range in the same
Zone with a d12. \
**Reach:** No excess damage in return if they lose a clash/melee
failure. Can still be countered on a Botch. \
**Reload:** Use (reload) Actions needed to ready the weapon before
firing again. \
**Stun:** does full rolled damage when striking to Subdue. \
**Wrap:** ignore the target’s Shield bonus to AF.
